CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the comparison between traditional wind energy and airborne wind energy, their benefits, challenges, and opportunities. Traditional wind energy, characterized by spinning rotor comprised of composite blades and a tower-mounted nacelle & drivetrain, has been developed over 40 years with international standards and operates typically below 250 meters. It has an annual operational expenditure (OpEx) that is 23% of capital expenditure (CapEx) and is designed for a 25+ year operational life. Its support structure must resist significant overturning moments and its components are size-constrained by highway and rail transportation limits. On the other hand, airborne wind energy is a self-supported system tethered to a ground station, with either an airborne or ground-mounted drivetrain. It operates at variable altitudes typically between 200-800 meters. It has an annual OpEx that is 320% of CapEx as its major components may often be replaced or upgraded. The dominant load on its foundation is tether tension due to minimal overturning moments. It offers easier transportation as kites may disassemble or compress for transport. In terms of unit capacity, traditional wind energy offers 0-6 MW onshore and 6-15+ MW offshore, while airborne wind provides 0-2 MW onshore and up to 5 MW offshore. For wind farm integration, traditional wind uses 2D placement (latitude, longitude) while airborne wind uses 3D placement (latitude, longitude, altitude). As of 2020, wind energy provided 8.4 percent of electricity production in the U.S., making it the largest source of renewable energy in the country. It also accounted for 47.4 percent of new electricity capacity commissioned in the United States in that year. However, there are challenges to the continued deployment of traditional wind technology such as exhaustion of best wind resources on land due to significant growth and transportation logistics challenges due to larger rotors and taller towers. Airborne wind technology can resolve these issues by replacing the support structure with a lightweight tether, reducing mass by around 90 percent which could lead to lower lifecycle emissions and lower visual footprint. This technology can harvest wind at higher altitudes which are often stronger and more consistent. It also has the ability to adjust its flight path to optimize power production, control its influence on neighboring airborne devices, and mitigate airspace use conflicts or viewshed concerns. It can be quickly deployed or re-deployed and lowered to the ground for maintenance, potentially opening new markets and improving technician safety. Its lower mass inputs, easier logistics, and potentially higher capacity factor may lead to a reduced cost of energy compared to traditional wind technology in certain regions or markets. The International Renewable Energy Agency has stated that airborne wind energy could be a game changer and ranks it as the third most important technology below next-generation offshore turbines and floating foundations.
