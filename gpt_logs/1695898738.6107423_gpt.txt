As directed by the Energy Act of 2020, this report outlines the potential for, and technical viability of, airborne wind energy systems to provide a significant source of energy in the United States going forward. Further, it lays out the research and development (R&amp;D) that this nascent industry would need to demonstrate its viability over the next decade. This report does not explore tethered multipurpose platforms concepts whose main purpose is telecommunication or observation rather than electricity production (e.g., Toyotas Mothership [3] or blimp-like concepts from Omnidea [4], Altaeros [5]).

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This research article snippet discusses the challenges and opportunities of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems in the United States. AWE technologies are fundamentally different from traditional wind turbines in terms of design, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, installation, operations, and maintenance. However, there is currently no convergence on a preferred AWE technology or approach, and no commercially deployed megawatt-scale AWE systems exist. The article emphasizes the need for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization activities to validate the technical and economic viability of AWE systems. These activities include characterizing the wind resource above traditional wind turbines, conducting cost and feasibility studies, deepening the understanding of AWE concepts through modeling and simulation, establishing test facilities and research capacities, encouraging industry R&D, participating in standards-setting organizations, assessing social acceptance and environmental implications, attracting talent for the AWE industry, and exploring cost-effective policies and technical assistance mechanisms. The relative priority and timing of these activities would depend on the desired commercial timeline and availability of funding. The article also mentions the legislative language that requires the submission of this report and provides information on the purpose and method of the study.
