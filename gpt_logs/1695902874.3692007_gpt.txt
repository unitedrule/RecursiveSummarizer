RESPONSE:

The research article, written by researchers from Chalmers University of Technology and NTNU, explores the potential value of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) to the electricity system. AWE, a new power generation technology, utilizes tethered wings to harness wind energy at high altitudes. Due to the higher wind speeds at these altitudes, AWE is expected to yield more energy than traditional wind turbines (WTs). Additionally, the use of less material in the construction of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) suggests a lower cost compared to WTs. However, since commercial systems are not yet available, further detailed information about costs and power generation is lacking. To address this, the study estimates the economic value of AWE in future electricity systems and determines what cost levels are required for AWE to be competitive. The study uses ERA-5 wind data to calculate power generation from wind power technologies and implements these findings into a cost-minimizing electricity system model. The model forces a certain percentage of annual electricity demand to be supplied by AWESs in order to investigate the marginal system value (MSV) of AWE. The MSV is influenced by factors such as AWE share, wind resources, and temporal distribution of AWES's electricity generation. Findings suggest that the MSV of AWE is both location-and system-dependent and ranges between 1.4 and 2.2 M= MW at a low share of AWE supply (0%30%). However, as the share increases, the MSV decreases. The study also reveals a correlation between the power generation of WTs and AWESs, indicating that they could potentially be used interchangeably as similar power sources. The study concludes that introducing AWESs will have a minimal impact on the cost-optimal wind power share in the electricity system unless an AWES cost far below the system-specific MSV is achieved. The key terms used in the study are airborne wind energy, electricity system modelling, and marginal system value.
