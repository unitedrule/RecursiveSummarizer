RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the future prospects of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs), a technology that is not yet commercially available but has potential for both small-scale off-grid solutions and large-scale installations, both onshore and offshore. The potential for large-scale usage of AWESs has been analyzed based on reanalysis wind data resources and Lidar wind speed measurements at the location of Pritzwalk to estimate mid-altitude wind conditions and compute the optimal power production of an AWES. To compare the economic potential of different power generation technologies, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is often used. Previous studies estimate that AWES technology could offer electricity at a lower LCOE compared to conventional wind turbines, with estimates ranging between 33 and 150 MWh. However, these costs are still highly uncertain due to the nascent state of the technology. Apart from the LCOE, the electricity generation profile, i.e., the distribution of electricity production over time, is also a crucial aspect of any power generation technology. A study by Malz et al computed the optimal power generation profile for AWESs and traditional wind turbines using MERRA-2 wind data from various locations. The power generation profiles were found to be similar, especially in areas with low wind shear. Despite these findings, the role that AWE could play as part of the electricity system has not been analyzed in detail. This includes understanding how AWES units would interact with other power production technologies in the electricity system. A generation profile that correlates with the net load of the electricity system would have high economic value. In this context, net load is defined as system load minus other contributions to power production.
