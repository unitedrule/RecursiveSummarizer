CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the relationship between wind power technologies and thermal power generation, particularly focusing on the impact of the Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) share on the electricity system. A significant finding is that when the AWE share exceeds approximately 0.6, thermal base generation (mainly comprising nuclear and bio+natural gas CCS in this study) gets replaced by variable wind and solar power generation and costly thermal peak generation. The article presents this relationship using Figure 2A, which shows a clear decline in Marginal System Value (MSV) beyond an AWE share of around 0.6. The authors further illustrate this connection in Figure 3, showing the thermal generation in regions SE2 and HU for a LAWES (Land-based Airborne Wind Energy System) for ? = 100%. The data suggests that as the AWE share increases, so does the thermal peak power generation (biogas GT and biogas CCGT), while the thermal base load technologies decrease. Furthermore, a detailed analysis reveals that during the gradual replacement of Wind Turbines (WTs) by Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) at low shares (see SE2 at ? < 0.6 in Figure 3B), there is only a slight increase in peak power generation. This suggests a constant electricity share by wind energy but also indicates a higher generation variability of AWESs compared to WTs. The authors also note that beyond a point of ? 0:6, there is more saturation by general wind energy, leading to a significant decline in thermal base production and an increase in thermal peak production. This results in a drop in total thermal power generation, which is expected due to increased energy supply by wind power technologies and resulting system saturation. The researchers also discuss rare cases of an increase in MSV (Figure 2C, sAWE-100%), which occurs when, at low shares, AWE capacity is installed in low wind-speed classes and then shifts to high wind-speed classes at higher shares. This allows the same amount of energy to be generated with less installed capacity because installations in high-wind classes have a greater number of Full Load Hours (FLHs). The article concludes by suggesting that the impact of the number of FLHs per class for each region, power density, and profile value will be discussed in the following sections.
