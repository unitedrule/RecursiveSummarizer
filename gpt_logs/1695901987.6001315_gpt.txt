class for WTs is the same as that defined for that wind class for the AWESs. The wind speed interval and land surface area of the different classes can be found in Section 3 in Table 3 for each region, respectively. All generation profiles of a technology that fall within a certain wind class are averaged to one representative profile of that wind class.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the implementation of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) electricity generation profiles and Wind Turbine (WT) profiles into an electricity system model. The model is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) and solved with the solver CPLEX. Originally developed by Gansson et al, the model functions as a regional investment and dispatch model to study thermal power plant cycling. Its main decision variables are the regional installed capacity (s) of each technology and the hourly electricity generation (g). The total electricity generation of all installed technologies must meet the hourly regional load at minimal annual system cost and net-zero CO2 emissions. It is set up as a green-field study, assuming no prior installation of power plants. The purpose of the model is to study the dynamics of a potential system with net-zero CO2 emissions, rather than predicting future electricity system composition. The model operates on a three-hourly time resolution, assumes perfect foresight, and neglects distribution losses and ancillary services. It captures the variability aspect of wind and solar power but overlooks losses and uncertainty. Four regions are modeled: Ireland (IE), Hungary (HU), south-central Sweden (SE2), and central Spain (ES3). Each region is modeled in isolation, excluding import and export of electricity. The main equations of the LP problem include the problem objective that minimizes annual system cost for investment and dispatch, constraining generation-load balance, and capacity limiting generation. The total annual system cost is denoted by variable ctot. Variable si represents the installed capacity of technology i, while gi,t represents the generation of technology i at time step t. The parameter Cinv is the initial investment cost per technology, and AFi is the annuity factor, dependent on a technology's technical lifetime. Technologies included in the model results are AWE systems of wind class 1,2,3,4,5, onshore wind energy systems of wind class 1,2,3,4,5, hydropower with storage, nuclear power, photovoltaic with fixed optimal tilt (crystalline silicon cells), biogas-fueled combined cycle gas turbine, and biogas-fueled open cycle gas turbine.
