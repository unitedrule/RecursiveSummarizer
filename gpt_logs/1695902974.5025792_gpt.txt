RESPONSE:

This study investigates the economic value of electricity generation from airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) in four different regional electricity systems, focusing on drag-mode AWESs. These types of AWESs generate electric power via on-board propellers and transfer it to the ground through a tether. The research models the annual generation profiles of two differently sized AWESs within four characteristic regions, with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees, which in Southern Sweden equates to an area of approximately 430 km2. Unlike wind turbines (WT), which are modeled using a power curve for a 2 MW generator, the power generation of AWES is computed through a complex optimal control problem (OCP). This approach takes into account physical limitations like tether drag and computes the maximum power production and optimal flight trajectory given prevailing wind speeds. The computed electricity generation profiles are implemented in a regional cost-minimizing electricity system model formulated as a linear optimization problem. The model investigates the interaction between different generation, load, and storage technologies. It is built as a green-field model, assuming no prior installed capacity. The technologies included in the model are linked to their respective installation and power generation costs. In this study, instead of modeling the AWE technology related to an estimated cost, a certain installed AWE capacity is enforced in the electricity system model. The AWE generation profile is assumed to be a free source of energy. The economic value of AWESs to the electricity system can be quantified in terms of the marginal system value (MSV), which is computed as the change in annual total electricity system cost divided by the change in installed capacity of AWESs. This computation allows for estimation of the maximum cost of technology for being economically viable in a future emission-free electricity system. MSV can also be interpreted as the willingness to pay for adding AWE capacity to the system. Since AWE technology is still under development, its value is mainly relevant for future electricity systems. Accordingly, this work applies emission constraints and technology costs corresponding to 2050 projections.
