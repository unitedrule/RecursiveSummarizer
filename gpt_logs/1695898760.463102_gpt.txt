Hermann Honnef (writing in 1939, translated in 1974) dreamed of high-altitude wind power [18], and key innovations in kite technologies occurred in the second half of the 20th century, like the Rogallo ParaWing [19] once considered for returning Gemini space capsules to Earth, and Flexifoil [20], the predecessor of the modern power or traction kite used in soft kite AWES today. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Several key publications on airborne wind date to the late 1970s and early 1980s including Hermann Oberth [21], Bryan Roberts [22], and Miles Loyd [1]. However, the field began to accelerate in 2001 with the work of Wubbo Ockels, a Dutch physicist and European astronaut. At Delft University of Technology in 2001, Ockels published a paper on the Laddermill, a ground-gen concept to harvest energy from high altitudes up to 10 km [23]. His research group at Delft then proposed a pumping mill design that is the predecessor of many ground-gen concepts [24] and began to consider concepts that fly lower in the atmosphere [25]. Ockels research led to two spinoff companies and to a growing global network of AWE researchers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs that now encompasses more than 60 organizations [2]. The U.S. community, shown graphically in  <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Figure 4</Reference> , has fewer players than Europe. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"><Figure>  <ImageData src="images/2021 - Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Ene_img_9.jpg"/> </Figure>   </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Figure 4. U.S. organizations with demonstrated interest in airborne wind energy, from NREL 2021 [7] </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">From 2009 to 2012, the airborne wind community gathered for annual international conferences, beginning in 2009 in Chico, California, and alternating between locations in the United States and Europe. Starting in 2013, the conference was held biennially in various locations around Europe. More than 220 delegates from 21 countries attended the 2019 conference [26]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Commercial Status and Funding </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Globally, the AWE market has many players, with heavy weighting toward Europe where public sector support is historically stronger. Most proposed AWES are at or below a technology readiness level (TRL) <Link>2</Link>  of 6 [27], where TRL 6 implies a large prototype, flown in a relevant environment, capable of performing all the functions that the operational system will require. Only one company globally has shipped a commercial product as of publication (SkySails), but all expect to do so within 15 years. The entry market for nearly every company is for distributed, remote, or microgrid applications. Most companies have plans to scale up to larger products by 2030. In Europe, the EU and national/regional organizations have awarded AWE grants of approximately 49M ($58M) since 2008 [28], and the technology is expected to need </P>  <Footnote> <P xml:lang="EN-US">2 Technical Readiness Level is a measure of the maturity of a technology, rated on a scale of 19, where 9 is the most mature. </P> continued RD&amp;D assistance and substantial market support to reach commercialization by 2025. In the United States, Federal entities have supported the development of AWE technology with approximately $13M direct investment since 2009, through one ARPA-E OPEN award [29], multiple SBIR awards from DOD, USDA, and NSF [30], and NSF funding to universities [31]. There has also been $11.9M of investment in kite-like devices for underwater energy harvesting, both to support long-duration autonomous missions (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [32]) and terrestrial use (ARPA-E SHARKS program [33] and DOEs Water Power Technologies Office [34]). On an annual basis, European funding for AWE has been approximately four times higher than in the United States between 2010 and 2020. Aside from public funds, some developers can raise capital from outside investorsmore than $200M according to Bloomberg as of 2019 [35].  </Footnote>  <P id="LinkTarget_948" xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <H1 xml:lang="EN-US">IV. Review of State of the Art </H1>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The review in this section summarizes three efforts at assessing the state of the AWE market: (1) An EU-commissioned report on the challenges of commercializing AWE in Europe [36], (2) a recent expert meeting that aimed to formalize international collaboration on AWE [37], and (3) a U.S.-centric airborne wind workshop [6] held in support of the present report. These resources address one or more aspects of the Congressional request and are consistent in their conclusions and recommendations, lending emphasis to the recommendations that will follow in Section  <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">V</Reference> . </P>  <P id="LinkTarget_950" xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <H2 xml:lang="EN-US">2018 European Union-Commissioned Report </H2>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Purpose and Method </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">In 2018, the European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation commissioned a report on the current state of AWE in Europe to guide the best use of public funding for further technology development [36]. Comparable to the present report, the EU authors were also tasked with the question of whether AWES are expected to contribute significantly to the European energy system. In addition to desk research, the authors used a variety of methods including scoping interviews, stakeholder engagement of 38 stakeholders through semi-structured interviews, focus groups on select themes, and a validation workshop. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Key Conclusions </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The EU study concluded that AWE technology is still immature, and it is not clear whether the technology has the potential to contribute significantly to the EU energy supply and decarbonization targets. Specifically, the authors found that AWEs potential impact on the energy system was sensitive to the scale of the AWES being deployed. Small- to medium-scale systems tend to target niche markets and will likely not have an impact on the EU energy system. However, even if the AWES scale up successfully, challenges remain. For safety reasons, a desire to deploy AWES away from populated areas implies that the market entry for land-based AWES will likely occur outside of population-dense Europe. If they are deployed in Europe, they may compete for space with conventional wind, limiting the complementarity of the technology. Complementarity is an area that needs further research. Offshore, AWES will face challenges due to the harsh environment and because their operating expenses are expected to be a higher fraction of their total cost than traditional wind turbines. The authors note that EU does have an industrial leadership position in this technology and may leverage that as an export advantage, even if deployments are not substantial within Europe.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The report also lays out a detailed phased-gate approach that enables the public sector to participate in risk-controlled AWE development (see Figure ES.3 for example in [36]). The EU report includes several recommendations, quoted below followed by a paraphrased explanation. </P>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Prove continuous operations: define, achieve, and prove reliability targets. Focus on setting and achieving reliability targets and enabling developers to share the evidence. AWES field data will be necessary to address many non-technological barriers  like wildlife impacts, investor confidence, and regulatory approval. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Substantiate the AWES case: deepen insight in resource potential and resource complementarity. Collaborate with the AWE sector to better characterize the wind resource from 100-meter (m) to 1000-m altitude through publicly funded measurement and analysis. Confirm resource potential and complementarity before funding full-scale demonstrations. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Anchor learning: build on previous experiences and improve fundamental understanding. Prototype and company failures are to be expected when developing new technology. Public funding should strive to help the sector learn from these failures, anchoring industry progress and preventing repeated missteps. Because of intellectual property concerns, consider promoting informal exchange mechanisms like R&amp;D consortia and test sites. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Create a hub: concentrate testing activities in one geographic location. A test site is a good informal exchange mechanism. The public sector should explore the development of a European test site for AWES. Consult with the sector to determine test site requirements and apply incentives (24/7 operation approval, lower testing fees, wind resource data, grid connectivity, etc.) </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Utilize technology crossovers: invest in enabling technologies. AWES developments have benefitted from enabling technologies like automation, composite materials, and drone technology. Investments in these sectors will provide a return regardless of AWES success or failure. AWES developers should highlight areas where enabling technology needs improvement for AWES applications. </LBody> </LI> </L>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Build mutual trust: set realistic expectations and offer a conditional outlook of stable support. Communication of development timelines and milestones from developers to the public sector helps build the rationale for public funding. This can also help the public sector provide a stable funding outlook, with clear expectations of what kinds of support are available when performance metrics are achieved. Collaboration on common challenges can help accelerate AWE technology development. </LBody> </LI> </L>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Many of the reports findings could easily refer to and be applicable to the U.S. market. U.S.-specific traits to consider, for perspective, are the delay of offshore wind deployment relative to Europe, the lack of wind energy penetration in the southeast United States, the generally lower population density, and differences in the airspace regulatory environment. One substantial difference is that the United States does not hold an industrial or technological leadership position in AWES, and therefore is not likely to benefit from export of this technology.  </P>  <P id="LinkTarget_919" xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <H2 xml:lang="EN-US">2020 Airborne Wind Energy Topical Expert Meeting </H2>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">International Energy Agency Wind: History and Purpose </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The International Energy Agency (IEA), founded in 1974 to coordinate a unified response to oil supply disruptions, runs a series of Technology Collaboration Programs (TCPs) to promote co-operation and leverage international R&amp;D to accelerate energy technology development.

RESPONSE:

This research article snippet discusses the challenges and opportunities for airborne wind energy. It provides a historical context of kite technologies and their use in various applications. The field of airborne wind energy began to accelerate in 2001 with the work of Wubbo Ockels and has since grown into a global network of researchers and organizations. The commercial status and funding of airborne wind energy are also discussed. The market is dominated by European players due to stronger public sector support, but there is potential for growth worldwide. Most proposed airborne wind energy systems are still in the early stages of development, with only one company having shipped a commercial product so far. Funding from public and private sources has been significant, with European funding being four times higher than in the United States between 2010 and 2020. The article also reviews the state of the art in airborne wind energy, summarizing three efforts at assessing the market. These include an EU-commissioned report, an expert meeting on international collaboration, and a U.S.-centric workshop. The reports highlight the immaturity of the technology and the challenges it faces in terms of scalability, safety, and complementarity with conventional wind turbines. The EU report provides detailed recommendations for the public sector to participate in risk-controlled development of airborne wind energy. These recommendations include proving continuous operations, substantiating the case for airborne wind energy, anchoring learning from previous experiences, creating a testing hub, utilizing technology crossovers, and building mutual trust between developers and the public sector. Overall, while airborne wind energy shows promise, there are still significant challenges to overcome before it can contribute significantly to the global energy system.
