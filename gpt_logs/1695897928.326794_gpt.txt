CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The concept of using kites as an alternative to horizontal axis wind turbines was first proposed in 1980 by Miles Loyd, a researcher at DOEs Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. His paper initiated discussions on airborne wind energy (AWE), but the technology and control methods at the time were inadequate for commercial development. For the following four decades, traditional horizontal axis wind turbines received the majority of Federal wind research funding. Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) convert wind energy into electricity using tethered flying devices. Since the early 2000s, there has been a global interest in AWE, with advocates, researchers, and businesses exploring its potential. In accordance with the Energy Act of 2020, a report has been compiled to assess the potential and technical viability of AWES as a significant energy source for the United States. The report also outlines the research and development (R&D) required to demonstrate its viability over the next decade. However, this report does not consider tethered multipurpose platforms intended primarily for telecommunications or observation rather than electricity production. It also does not analyze concepts that aim to access wind resources higher than one kilometer. The report is divided into several sections. Section III provides an overview of AWE technology, including its benefits, challenges, primary design choices, historical context, sources of support to date, and an overview of global market leaders. Section IV delves into recent reports which summarize: the European Union's market outlook for AWE; proceedings from a meeting of International Energy Agency (IEA) technical experts on AWE; and findings from the U.S. Airborne Wind Energy workshop sponsored by DOE and hosted by NREL in March 2021. Section V discusses challenges and opportunities facing the U.S. AWE market based on literature reviews, technology developer interviews, input from U.S. stakeholders at the AWE workshop, and NREL analysis. It covers potential resources, technology viability, research, development, demonstration needs, and commercialization barriers. The concluding section (Section VI) discusses the role of future research in realizing the potential of airborne wind energy. The report further describes AWE as a unique technology distinct from traditional wind energy. It compares the difference between traditional hydropower and marine hydrokinetic systems to illustrate the difference between established and newly emerging technologies. A table is provided to highlight the fundamental differences between traditional wind energy and AWE.
