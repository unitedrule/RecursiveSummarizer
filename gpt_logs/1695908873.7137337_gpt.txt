CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The research focuses on the optimal modelled annual energy mix for SE2, with a density factor of 10% for the LAWES (Large Airborne Wind Energy Systems) and the sAWES (Small Airborne Wind Energy Systems). The system was optimized with varying investment and O&M for AWE (Airborne Wind Energy), and the costs were compared to the modelled wind turbine (WT) cost. The results showed how the class areas are allocated among wind power technologies and how these technologies compete with each other. The study also presented a map of SE2, displaying the average full load hours (FLHs) for each technology - WT, sAWES, and LAWES. It was observed that WT had the lowest FLHs in the Northern part, making those areas more attractive for AWESs. Coastal areas were similar for all wind power technologies, with power density being the main decision factor for technology allocation. A comparison of FLHs between AWESs and WT highlighted regions where modelled AWESs had an advantage over WT. Inland and hilly areas were found to provide AWESs with a greater advantage than coastal and offshore areas. This is in line with findings from a previous study where it was noted that wind shear played a vital role in AWES performance. AWESs could utilize high-altitude winds better if wind shear was high, using adjustable operation altitude as an advantage. The research also discussed the consequences of assumptions, limitations, and model choices, highlighting the uncertainty around two density factors - available space and AWE farm density which are dependent on land and airspace regulation as well as acceptance. Furthermore, it is important to note that the study assumed perfect foresight on weather and demand when modelling power generation of wind power systems and optimization of the electricity grid. This assumption could potentially underestimate the costs of wind integration as thermal power cycling is planned with perfect information available. The research concluded with a comparison of absolute FLHs of AWESs and WT in SE2, showing that sAWES has an advantage over LAWE.
