CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article presents an energy system model that incorporates five Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) electricity generation profiles of all wind classes, as well as five Wind Turbine (WT) profiles. The model is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem, developed in GAMS and solved using solver CPLEX. Originally developed by Gansson et al, this model was primarily used to study thermal power plant cycling. The key decision variables of the LP problem are the regional installed capacity (s) of each technology and the hourly electricity generation (g). The total electricity generation from all installed technologies should meet the hourly regional load at minimum annual system cost and net-zero CO2 emissions. The model is set as a green-field study, assuming no prior installation of power plants. It aims to explore the dynamics of a potential system with net-zero CO2 emissions, rather than predicting future electricity system composition. The model's time resolution is three-hourly, assuming perfect foresight, while neglecting distribution losses and ancillary services. Therefore, it captures the variability aspect of wind and solar power but overlooks losses and uncertainty aspects. Four regions are modeled: Ireland (IE), Hungary (HU), south-central Sweden (SE2), and central Spain (ES3), each modeled in isolation without considering electricity import and export. The main equations of the LP problem include the problem objective that minimizes the annual system cost for investment and dispatch, along with constraining generation-load balance and capacity limiting generation. The decision variable ctot denotes the total annual system cost; si represents the installed capacity of technology i; gi,t represents the generation of technology i at time step t; I denotes the set of included technologies; T indicates the set of time steps (every third hour of the year); Cinv is the initial investment cost per technology; AFi is the annuity factor, dependent on a technology's technical lifetime. The technologies included in the model are AWE (1,2,3,4,5) which represents Airborne wind energy system of wind class 1,2,3,4,5 and WT (1,2,3,4,5) which represents Onshore wind energy system of wind class.
