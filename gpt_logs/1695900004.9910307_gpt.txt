the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). As an example, in13 the economic potential of an AWE park is evaluated using a quasi-steady flight model for the power curve estimation of the AWES. That work and most other studies5,9,14,15 estimate that AWE technology could offer electricity at a lower LCOE compared to conventional wind turbines. The estimates of the LCOE for AWESs range between roughly 33 and 150 M= Wh. The large span indicates that the actual costs are still highly uncertain. Apart from the LCOE, a crucial aspect of a power generation technology is the electricity generation profile, that is, the distribution of the electricity production in time. The work in Malz et al16 computes the optimal power generation profile of AWESs and the one of traditional wind turbines, using MERRA-2 wind data from different locations. The power generation profiles of the two wind technologies are compared and found to be similar, especially at places with a low wind shear.* </P>  <P>So far, work has focused on assessing wind data for AWES operation, computing the power generation and assessing the economic potential of isolated AWESs. However, the role that AWE could play as a part of the electricity system has not been analysed in detail yet.

A generation profile that correlates with the net load of the electricity system has a high economical value. Here, the net load is defined by the system load minus renewable generation.

RESPONSE:

The research article delves into the evaluation of the economic potential of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) and their role within the electricity system. Prior studies suggest that AWES technology might offer electricity at a lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) compared to conventional wind turbines, with the estimated LCOE for AWESs ranging from approximately 33 to 150 M= Wh. Furthermore, the generation profile of AWESs, i.e., their temporal distribution of electricity production, is seen as having a significant impact on their economic value in the electricity system. This study aims to analyze the economic value of AWESs' electricity generation within four different regional electricity systems, taking into account the temporal distribution of the electricity. The focus is on drag-mode AWESs, which generate electric power via onboard propellers and transfer it to the ground through a tether. To estimate the economic value of these systems, the annual generation profiles of two differently sized AWESs are modeled within four characteristic regions, with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees. The power generation of AWE is computed through a complex optimal control problem (OCP), which accounts for physical limitations like tether drag and calculates maximum power production and optimal flight trajectory based on prevailing wind speeds. This method allows for optimization of flight trajectory and operation height – an advantage over conventional wind turbines. The computed electricity generation profiles are incorporated into a regional cost-minimizing electricity system model formulated as a linear optimization problem. This model investigates the interaction among different generation, load, and storage technologies under the assumption of no prior installed capacity. Instead of modeling AWE technology related to estimated costs, a certain installed AWE capacity is enforced in the model and assumed to be a free source of energy. The economic value of AWESs to the electricity system can then be quantified in terms of the marginal system value (MSV). The study signifies the importance of AWESs' interaction with other power production technologies in the electricity system and the correlation of their generation profile with the net load of the system.
