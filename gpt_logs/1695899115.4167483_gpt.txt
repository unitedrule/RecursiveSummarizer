For airborne wind, a nascent, unproven technology, to achieve significant commercial success by 2035 would require a rapid expansion of R&amp;D activities and an acceleration of commercialization that is unprecedented in energy production technology. For a sense of scale, Federal support of wind energy research dates back over four decades, the wind production tax credit almost three decades, and it has taken nearly that long for wind to become commercially competitive across much of the country. AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, but the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines (for AWE and other clean technologies) and the evolution of the U.S. power sector size and requirements means that projection is much more difficult to make with confidence.</rdf:li>             </rdf:Alt>          </dc:description>          <pdf:Producer>Adobe PDF Library 21.7.131</pdf:Producer>          <pdfx:SourceModified>D:20211109191149</pdfx:SourceModified>          <pdfx:Company>U.S. Department of Energy</pdfx:Company>          <pdfx:ContentTypeId>0x010100055405B08DD34D4DB118DDB88C246E4B</pdfx:ContentTypeId>          <pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>46b98e98-c3e6-4322-8bfa-12cf298a26a4</pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>       </rdf:Description>    </rdf:RDF> </x:xmpmeta>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <?xpacket end="w"?> <?xpacket end='r'?> <bookmark-tree> <bookmark title="I.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This research article snippet is a report to Congress titled "Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Energy in the United States." The report discusses the potential for airborne wind energy (AWE) to become a significant source of energy in the United States. It emphasizes that for AWE to achieve commercial success by 2035, there would need to be a rapid expansion of research and development (R&D) activities and unprecedented acceleration of commercialization. The report also highlights the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines and the evolution of the U.S. power sector, making it difficult to project AWE becoming a significant energy source by 2050 with confidence. The report was prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The assessment was based on a synthesis of existing literature, internal analysis by NREL, and interviews with AWE industry leaders. WETO also organized a technical workshop on U.S. Airborne Wind Energy in March 2021, which was attended by over 100 experts and stakeholders. The report provides the following conclusions: 1. The technical resource potential of wind energy available to AWE systems is uncertain, but likely similar to that available to traditional wind energy systems. The extent to which AWE represents an additional wind energy resource is unclear and depends on the energy harvesting characteristics of commercial designs. However, even without considering additionality, the wind energy resource (including traditional wind energy) remains significant compared to national electricity use. 2. If AWE can be captured economically, it has the potential to provide a significant source of energy. However, AWE is still an immature and unproven technology that requires further R&D. The report concludes by acknowledging that while AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, the uncertain factors related to technology costs and the evolving power sector make projecting its viability challenging. The report is accompanied by figures and images related to the DOE's logo, the challenges and opportunities for airborne wind energy, and the contact information for further inquiries. It also includes a message from the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, and a list of Members of Congress to whom the report is being provided.
