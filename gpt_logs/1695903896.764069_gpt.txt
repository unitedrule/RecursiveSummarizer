In fact, in the vast majority of the investigated cases, the AWESs simply replace traditional wind turbines as the cost of the AWES is reduced.

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the comparative performance of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) and Wind Turbines (WTs) in various wind conditions. It is observed that the thermal generation for larger AWES systems is more variable than smaller ones. The difference in profile value between high and low wind classes is more significant for WTs than AWES, making it cost-efficient to place AWES in low-wind classes. In less windy regions, larger AWES have fewer Full Load Hours (FLHs) than WTs, resulting in a Market System Value (MSV) of Large Airborne Wind Energy Systems (LAWES) consistently below the reference cost of WTs. To illustrate the allocation of wind technologies, the results of varying AWES costs in the model were displayed across different illustrative scenarios. The optimal electricity mix for region SE2 in Sweden, meeting an annual electrical energy demand of 92,491 GWh, consists of approximately 50% wind power, 13% hydro power, and 37% thermal power generation. The optimal energy mix for equal costs for AWES and WTs yields an AWE share of the electricity mix of 0.1. This matches the scenario where MSV of AWE equals the costs of WTs. Two main findings are highlighted: firstly, AWE needs to be much cheaper relative to WT to increase total wind energy share. Secondly, AWES are preferentially allocated to low wind-speed sites while WTs are placed in high wind-speed sites. The total share of 50% wind power generation in SE2 remains constant across all scenarios unless AWES becomes significantly cheaper or achieves a high power density. This research also shows that if both technologies are part of electricity production, one technology replaces the other without changing the total share of wind power in the system. As such, even if AWE becomes economically viable, it simply replaces traditional wind turbines in most investigated cases. The competition between these two technologies is mainly due to their similar electricity generation profiles.
