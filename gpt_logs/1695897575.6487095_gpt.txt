As directed by the Energy Act of 2020, this report outlines the potential for, and technical viability of, airborne wind energy systems to provide a significant source of energy in the United States going forward. Further, it lays out the research and development (R&amp;D) that this nascent industry would need to demonstrate its viability over the next decade. This report does not explore tethered multipurpose platforms concepts whose main purpose is telecommunication or observation rather than electricity production (e.g., Toyotas Mothership [3] or blimp-like concepts from Omnidea [4], Altaeros [5]).

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This article snippet discusses the various elements and activities involved in the development and commercialization of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) technology. These include research fellowships, centers of excellence, prize competitions, and other training mechanisms. The article emphasizes the importance of exploring cost-effective policies and technical assistance mechanisms for AWE technology. The relative priority and timing of these elements over a 10-year period would depend on factors such as the desired commercial timeline, availability of funding, and the targeted AWE market. The article also mentions the legislative language that requires a report on the potential and technical viability of AWE systems in the United States, as well as the purpose and method of the report. It highlights the history and development of AWE technology, its potential benefits and challenges, and provides an overview of global market leaders. The article concludes by discussing the challenges and opportunities facing the U.S. AWE market in terms of potential resources and technology viability.
