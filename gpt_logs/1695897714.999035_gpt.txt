For airborne wind, a nascent, unproven technology, to achieve significant commercial success by 2035 would require a rapid expansion of R&amp;D activities and an acceleration of commercialization that is unprecedented in energy production technology. For a sense of scale, Federal support of wind energy research dates back over four decades, the wind production tax credit almost three decades, and it has taken nearly that long for wind to become commercially competitive across much of the country. AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, but the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines (for AWE and other clean technologies) and the evolution of the U.S. power sector size and requirements means that projection is much more difficult to make with confidence.</rdf:li>             </rdf:Alt>          </dc:description>          <pdf:Producer>Adobe PDF Library 21.7.131</pdf:Producer>          <pdfx:SourceModified>D:20211109191149</pdfx:SourceModified>          <pdfx:Company>U.S. Department of Energy</pdfx:Company>          <pdfx:ContentTypeId>0x010100055405B08DD34D4DB118DDB88C246E4B</pdfx:ContentTypeId>          <pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>46b98e98-c3e6-4322-8bfa-12cf298a26a4</pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>       </rdf:Description>    </rdf:RDF> </x:xmpmeta>


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The document, titled "Report to Congress: Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Energy in the United States", is produced by the U.S. Department of Energy, Wind Energy Technologies Office. The report, created on November 9, 2021, and modified on December 8, 2021, addresses the question posed by Congress regarding the viability of airborne wind energy as a significant source of energy in the United States. The report highlights that for airborne wind energy (AWE), a nascent and unproven technology, to achieve substantial commercial success by 2035 would necessitate an unprecedented acceleration in research and development (R&D) activities and commercialization in the realm of energy production technology. The report further puts into perspective that federal support for wind energy research has spanned over four decades, with the wind production tax credit existing for nearly three decades, indicating the time it has taken for wind energy to become commercially competitive across much of the country. The report suggests that AWE could become a significant energy source by 2050; however, due to uncertainties in estimating technological cost declines (for AWE and other clean technologies) and changes in the U.S. power sector size and requirements, this projection is challenging to make with confidence.
