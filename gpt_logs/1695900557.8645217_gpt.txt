RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on the optimization of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). The algebraic state z of AWES, tether constraints, and control inputs such as the change of surface controls and the drag force of on-board propellers are discussed. The parameters p include the wind data. The cost functional (3a) maximizes the average power generation of one trajectory during the orbit time T and regularizes the control inputs. The system function (3b) describes flight dynamics, while constraints (3c) enforce periodicity of the flight trajectory and (3d) introduce physical system bounds given by the physics of AWES. Two possible AWES systems are considered: a large AWES (LAWES) with 2 MW (40 m wing span) and a small AWES (sAWES) with 0.6 MW (28 m wing span), aligned to Makani wings. Due to the high nonlinearity, solving the OCP is challenging. A time-efficient numerical method that exploits similarity between consecutive OCP solutions resulting from different but similar wind profiles is proposed. A regression model is also trained to approximate the mapping between wind data and power generation. The study assumes that the distance of individual systems within an AWES farm is defined by maximum tether length set at 500 m. The total space needed is in form of a dome with a radius equal to twice the tether length, resulting in an AWE farm power density of P,sAWE 0:6 and P;LAWE 2MW/km. The study also includes a sensitivity analysis accounting for different farm densities. The technology models and available wind data yield an hourly electricity generation profile over one year for each spatial grid point and each modelled technology. To reduce model size, generation profiles are grouped into five wind classes based on percentiles of average wind speeds at an altitude of 100 m. The study assumes that wind power installations are geographically evenly distributed across each wind class and that there is no grid congestion within the investigated region.
