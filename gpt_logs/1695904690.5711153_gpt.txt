RESPONSE:

This research study investigates the economic value of electricity generation from Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) in four different regional electricity systems, taking into consideration the temporal distribution of the electricity. The study specifically focuses on drag-mode AWESs, which generate electric power using onboard propellers and transfer it to the ground through a tether. The annual generation profiles of two differently sized AWESs are modeled within four characteristic regions, with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees, equivalent to an area of approximately 430 km2 in Southern Sweden. Unlike Wind Turbines (WTs), which are modeled using a power curve for a 2 MW generator, the power generation of AWESs is computed via a complex Optimal Control Problem (OCP). This method takes into account physical limitations like tether drag and calculates the maximum power production and optimal flight trajectory based on prevailing wind speeds. The option to optimize flight trajectory and operation height is seen as a significant advantage of AWESs over conventional WTs. The computed electricity generation profiles are then integrated into a regional cost-minimizing electricity system model that's formulated as a linear optimization problem. This model investigates the interaction between different generation, load, and storage technologies. It operates as a green-field model, meaning it assumes no prior installed capacity. The technologies included in the model are linked to their respective installation and power generation costs. In this study, instead of modeling the AWE technology relative to an estimated cost, a certain installed AWE capacity is enforced in the electricity system model. The AWE generation profile is considered as a free source of energy, thereby allowing for quantification of the economic value of AWESs to the electricity system in terms of Marginal System Value (MSV). MSV is defined as the change in annual total electricity system cost divided by the change in installed capacity of AWESs. The calculation of the MSV enables estimation of the maximum cost of technology to be economically viable in a future emission-free electricity system. It can also be interpreted as the willingness to pay for adding AWE capacity to the system. As AWE technology is still in development, its value is mainly relevant for future electricity systems. Therefore, this work applies emission constraints and technology costs corresponding to projections for 2050.
