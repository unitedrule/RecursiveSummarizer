CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The article titled "The value of airborne wind energy to the electricity system" by Malz EC, Walter V, Gansson L, and Gros S evaluates the potential of airborne wind energy (AWE) in the electricity system. In Appendix A, the researchers define the cp-value in terms of vw, vcp,maxb, cp,slope, cp,maxb, vcp,minb, and cp,min. The rated wind speed is calculated using Pcap, vrat, D2, cp,max and the break point wind speeds vcp,maxb and vcp,minb. The cp curve's slope is computed from cp,max, cp,min, and vcp,maxb - vcp,minb. Parameters for these calculations are sourced from a previous study and include external losses (0.94), maximum cp value (0.45), internal losses (0.885), minimum cp value (0.18), rotor diameter (100m), cut-in wind speed (3m/s), WT generator size (1.94MW), and cut-out wind speed (25m/s). In Appendix B, a mathematical model of the electricity system is presented as a linear programming problem aiming at minimizing total annual system costs. This model includes various sets, parameters, and variables detailed in Table B1 and the technology data relevant to this study are listed in Table B2. The model is formulated by the problem objective (4), load-supply balance equations (5), capacity limits (6), constrained area for wind technology installations (7), and a fixed electricity share supplied by AWEs (8). Hydro power storage at time t is constrained by water reservoir capacity, maximum power plant capacity, and weather-dependent inflow qin. Thermal power production technologies are limited by their cycling start-up and minimal load abilities. This study provides a comprehensive mathematical modeling approach to analyze the potential role of airborne wind energy in electricity systems.
