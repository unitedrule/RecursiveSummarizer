For airborne wind, a nascent, unproven technology, to achieve significant commercial success by 2035 would require a rapid expansion of R&amp;D activities and an acceleration of commercialization that is unprecedented in energy production technology. For a sense of scale, Federal support of wind energy research dates back over four decades, the wind production tax credit almost three decades, and it has taken nearly that long for wind to become commercially competitive across much of the country. AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, but the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines (for AWE and other clean technologies) and the evolution of the U.S. power sector size and requirements means that projection is much more difficult to make with confidence.</rdf:li>             </rdf:Alt>          </dc:description>          <pdf:Producer>Adobe PDF Library 21.7.131</pdf:Producer>          <pdfx:SourceModified>D:20211109191149</pdfx:SourceModified>          <pdfx:Company>U.S. Department of Energy</pdfx:Company>          <pdfx:ContentTypeId>0x010100055405B08DD34D4DB118DDB88C246E4B</pdfx:ContentTypeId>          <pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>46b98e98-c3e6-4322-8bfa-12cf298a26a4</pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>       </rdf:Description>    </rdf:RDF> </x:xmpmeta>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <?xpacket end="w"?> <?xpacket end='r'?> <bookmark-tree> <bookmark title="I.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This research article snippet is a report titled "Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Energy in the United States" by the U.S. Department of Energy, Wind Energy Technologies Office. The report aims to assess the potential and technical viability of airborne wind energy (AWE) as a significant source of energy in the United States. The report highlights that for AWE to achieve significant commercial success by 2035, there would need to be a rapid expansion of research and development activities and an unprecedented acceleration of commercialization. It mentions that federal support for wind energy research dates back over four decades, and it has taken nearly as long for wind energy to become commercially competitive. The report acknowledges that while AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, estimating technology cost declines and projecting the evolution of the U.S. power sector size and requirements with confidence is challenging. The report also mentions that it was prepared in response to language set forth in the Energy Act of 2020. It outlines a series of research, development, demonstration, and commercialization activities needed to advance, test, and potentially validate the viability of AWE systems. The report includes an executive summary that provides an overview of the research conducted by the Wind Energy Technologies Office in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It mentions that existing literature, internal analysis from NREL, and interviews with AWE industry leaders were used to explore the potential and technical viability of AWE technologies. Additionally, a technical workshop on U.S. Airborne Wind Energy was hosted by NREL in March 2021. Based on their assessment, the report concludes that the technical resource potential of wind energy available to AWE systems is uncertain but likely similar in magnitude to traditional wind energy systems. The additionality of AWE as an additional wind energy resource is not clear and depends on the energy harvesting characteristics of commercial designs. However, even without additionality, the resource remains significant compared to national electricity use. The report acknowledges that AWE is currently an immature and unproven technology that requires further development and cost reduction to be economically viable. However, if captured economically, AWE could provide a significant source of energy. The report concludes with a message from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, and provides contact information for further inquiries.
