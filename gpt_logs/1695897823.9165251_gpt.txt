RESPONSE:

The snippet is from a correspondence by Jennifer M. Granholm, addressed to Barrasso, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The contact details for additional information are provided, including Mr. Ali Nouri, Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Ms. Elizabeth Noll, Deputy Assistant Secretary for House Affairs, Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, reachable at (202) 586-5450. The core content pertains to a research report on Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) technologies prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This research is a response to provisions in The Energy Act of 2020. The study included a review of existing literature, internal analysis at NREL, and interviews with AWE industry leaders. WETO also supported a technical workshop on U.S. Airborne Wind Energy in March 2021, which was attended by over 100 experts and interested parties. The report presents an assessment of the potential and technical viability of airborne wind energy systems as a significant source of energy in the United States. The main findings include: 1. The technical resource potential of wind energy available to AWE systems is uncertain and likely similar to that available to traditional wind energy systems. Whether AWE represents an additional wind energy resource depends on the energy harvesting characteristics of commercial designs. 2. If economically viable, AWE could provide a significant source of energy. However, AWE is currently an immature and unproven technology that requires further development before it can be deployed at meaningful scales at the national level. 3. AWE technologies are fundamentally different from traditional wind turbines in their design, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, installation, operations, and maintenance. These differences present both challenges and opportunities that are not within the scope of traditional wind energy research and development (R&D). 4. AWE system designs are diverse and largely experimental, with no consensus on a preferred technology or approach. No megawatt-scale AWE systems have been commercially deployed so far, but several designs under development show promise. 5. AWE systems, like high-performance aircraft, must sustain flight through demanding atmospheric conditions. They also need to operate autonomously and are tethered to the ground, adding further challenges. The footnote clarifies that 'technical resource potential' represents the upper bound of achievable capacity and energy production considering social, environmental, and regulatory spatial considerations alongside technology performance and density assumptions.
