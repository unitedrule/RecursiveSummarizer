CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article explores the impact of differences in renewable energy resources across four representative regions, considering the expected electrification of the industrial sector by 2050. This electrification is estimated to increase annual electricity demand by 22.5% compared to current levels reported by ENTSO-E (2017)[49]. The anticipated electricity demand for each region is detailed in Table 2 and Table 3. The available area and total power density of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems are influenced by a variety of factors, including the power density of a wind farm, social acceptance of the technology, and installation site requirements. These factors are assumed to be location-independent, therefore the available installation area is not location-dependent. They can be reflected in the farm power density (expressed in MW=km). The final power density is calculated as the product of the initial system density ?P and a density factor ?. This study uses two density factors ? f0:1,1g. For wind turbines, a constant factor of 0.1 is used, indicating that wind parks can be installed on 10% of the available land[9,22]. The study models several scenarios in each region (summarized in Table 2 and Table 3), and calculates the marginal system value by varying the share of annual electricity demand supplied by Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) in these scenarios. This share ranges from 0 to 1. Table 2 details the electricity demand and land surface area available for wind power by region, along with properties of large AWES (LAWES), small AWES (sAWES), and Wind Turbines (WT): capacity, density, and the density factor ?. The regions studied include SE2 Sweden (windy & hydro), ES3 Spain (less windy & sunny), IE Ireland (windy & less sunny), and HU Hungary (medium windy/sunny). To supplement the Marginal System Value (MSV) calculations, an additional approach is used to explore the role of AWE in electricity systems. Instead of varying the electricity share of AWE, a potential cost is assigned to the AWES technology and varied in different model runs. For comprehensive comparison, the included AWES costs (investment and operation & maintenance costs) are set relative to WT costs, ranging from 0.5 to 1.2. This approach allows for a detailed examination of the relationship between traditional wind turbines and AWESs. The study assumes that sAWES and LAWES are implemented in individual model runs, separating system dynamics for clear interpretation and because it is expected that technology development will converge to the AWE configuration most relevant in future electricity systems. Results from this analysis are presented in section 3 of the study.
