With the substantial financial backing of Alphabet and Shell, top technical talent, and the highest power flying AWE system in the world, Makani was viewed as a global leader and their closure took many by surprise. Given their stature in the industry, a few words are warranted in this report on the companys story. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Makani Background </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Makani was founded in 2006 by entrepreneurs and kite surfers Saul Griffith, Corwin Hardham, and Don Montague, and quickly attracted funding from both Google and ARPA-E ($5.6M, OPEN 2009). Makani used soft kites but for the first few years, but had committed to rigid kites with fly-gen by 2010 [69]. With ARPA-E funding, they built what they called Wing 7, a 20kw fly-gen demonstrator. By the end of their performance period with ARPA-E, they had successfully demonstrated all modes flight with Wing 7, which means that the wing autonomously launched, flew away from the ground station, transitioned into crosswind flight, flew crosswind (where power is generated), transitioned out of crosswind flight, flew back to the ground station, and landed [69]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The company was acquired by Google X in 2013, and designed a built a new kite, scaled 30 times from 20kw to 600kw, known as the M600. After several years of testing the new design at China Lake, California, the team moved to a new test site in Hawaii with a new ground station and began repeatedly flying all modes in a series of 10 test flights. Royal Dutch Shell provided financial support and offshore expertise for seven months leading up to Makanis well-publicized offshore demonstration flight in August 2019. Their M600 kite launched from a floating spar buoy in Norway, flew autonomously in crosswind, and established several world firsts, but the flight ended with the loss of the kite during landing. The team returned to Hawaii to continue testing an earlier M600 airframe through December of 2019 [69]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">In February 2020, Makani announced it was leaving X (now an Alphabet company) and, unable to secure external funding, shut down that September [72]. Makanis CEO, Fort Felker, put it this way: </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">&quot;Creating an entirely new kind of wind energy technology means facing business challenges as well as engineering challenges. Despite strong technical progress, the road to commercialization is longer and riskier than hoped, so from today Makanis time at Alphabet is coming to an end. &quot; </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">As the company was winding down, members of the team could share the products of their many years of work. They released internal reports, presentations, flight logs and videos, simulation software, and sizing tools, and wrote a number of explanatory reports to help others learn what they had learned [66].  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Contributing Factors </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Using publicly available information, one can point to several possible contributing factors to Makanis closure in 2020. How these rank in significance or if other factors may have played a role, are not known. </P>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Power performance  Makanis largest kite, the M600, produced less power than expected in flight testing [66]. The primary contributors to the underperformance were (1) the worse-than-expected aerodynamic performance of the wing/tether system, and (2) the inability of the kite to fly circles as small as desired. Makanis design and simulation tools evolved to predict the underperformance and from those learnings they designed a follow-on kite, MX-2, that was believed to fix the shortcomings. However, this kite was never built.  </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Eroded cost advantage  In November 2017, the LCOE of land-based wind energy had fallen by approximately 50% [73] from the time of the original ARPA-E award in 2009. Makani made the decision to fly the M600 from a floating buoy, and the company pivoted toward a business opportunity in floating offshore wind. Floating offshore winds cost profile is a match for AWEthe most significant component of floating wind CapEx is the platform and substructure [49], and one of the core advantages of AWE is the potential for smaller and cheaper support structures. This pivot may have reduced the teams ability to focus on improving the performance of the kite as they took on the added challenge of flying from a floating buoy offshore. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Locked into rigid wing, fly-gen architecture  Makani moved away from their original soft kite concepts in 2009. Rapidly scaling the team and prototype size before fully understanding the smaller kites performance sensitivities may have locked in substantial tooling, development, and staffing costs, reducing the incentive to explore the overall design space. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Funding pressure  funding from Alphabet and Shell had rapid renewal cycles, and continued funding was contingent on achieving technical milestones [66]. This caused the team to take large leaps in scale (20kw to 600kw) and operating environment (onshore to offshore), sometimes without sufficient time or funding to retire risks. For the most part, this strategy paid off by pushing them to the forefront of the industry, but it also contributed to several crashes, including during the 2019 offshore demonstration [66]. Sundar Pichai became CEO of Alphabet in 2015, and the sunset of Makani was one of his first big moves after Google founders stepped away. Sundar may have been reacting to investor pressure to shore up the finances of the Other Bets business, which had poor financial performance in 2019, and of which Makani was a part [71]. However, the details of Alphabets and Shells decision are not public. </LBody> </LI> </L>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Lessons Learned </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Makani spent over a decade and many millions of dollars developing the fly-gen AWE concept, and the team arguably knew more than anyone else in the world about the strengths and shortcomings of that concept. The fact that they shared the hard-won lessons they learned means those years were not wasted and highlights the fact that their closure was connected to the Makani-specific AWE architecture, strategic decisions, and funding pressure. While Makani provides a cautionary story, this should not necessarily prevent further exploration of AWE concepts in general. </P> </Sect> </TaggedPDF-doc>


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the closure of Makani Windpower in 2020, a prominent company in the airborne wind energy sector. Makani was founded in 2006 and attracted funding from Google and ARPA-E. They developed a 20kw fly-gen demonstrator called Wing 7, which successfully demonstrated all modes of flight. The company was later acquired by Google X and designed a larger kite called M600. After testing and financial support from Royal Dutch Shell, Makani conducted an offshore demonstration flight in Norway but lost the kite during landing. In 2020, Makani announced its closure due to the challenges of commercialization and inability to secure external funding. Possible contributing factors to their closure include power performance issues, eroded cost advantage compared to land-based wind energy, being locked into a rigid wing, fly-gen architecture, and funding pressure. Despite the closure, Makani shared their knowledge and findings with the public. The article concludes that although Makani's closure serves as a cautionary tale, it should not discourage further exploration of airborne wind energy concepts.
