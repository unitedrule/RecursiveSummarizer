CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research conducted a detailed analysis of the electricity system model, focusing on the impact of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) and Wind Turbines (WTs). The study disregarded the role of storage technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, or fly wheels, and also did not consider demand side management (DSM). It was observed that both AWES and WTs are affected by these assumptions. The system was modelled for isolated regions, disallowing any form of trading, which is an unrealistic scenario. The results indicated a significant difference between small AWES (sAWES) and large AWES (LAWES). The sAWES of 666 kW showed a power profile of higher value and more full load hours (FLHs) than the LAWES due to its lower weight per wing area and lower tether drag. However, considering land area requirements, it is questionable whether the system with lower power density would be targeted for large scale deployment. The LAWES had up to 30% lower Marginal System Value (MSV) than sAWE and was less valued than a WT by up to 10%. In most scenarios, the optimal allocation of AWESs was in the lowest wind-speed classes where WTs were initially installed. This could be a decisive factor in planning and funding allocation. Factors like farm power density, FLHs, and acceptance should be maximized. Offshore locations were not considered in this study. However, AWE investors are looking into deep offshore solutions with floating foundations which could enhance AWE value and increase total wind power share in the electricity mix. Also, storage and load balancing within an AWE farm could compensate for their less even generation profile but this would increase costs. The AWE power profiles were obtained by optimizing a drag-mode system but it is uncertain how the results would differ for pumping-mode systems. Lloyd predicted in a previous study that the total power generation is similar for both systems.
