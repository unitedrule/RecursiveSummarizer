CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Based on the content provided, it is not possible to determine the purpose, research question, problem/issue, scope, participants, approach/method, key results, limitations, implications, and significance of the research. The text appears to be a list of references from a research article rather than the article itself. For a proper summary and discussion of these points, the full research article would be needed.
