RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the relationship between the standard deviation and the cut-in and cut-out point of a wind farm. It explains that a higher standard deviation results in a smoother transition at these points. The power curve of a single turbine is formulated using a mathematical equation where the rotor diameter is 100m and the generator size is 1.94 MW, assuming the specific power of the wind turbine is 247 W/m2. The internal and external losses are considered as 0.885 and 0.94 respectively while the efficiency varies depending on the wind speed. The cut-in and cut-out wind speeds are assumed to be 3m/s and 25m/s respectively. The article also highlights that the power of a wind farm is smoothed due to normally distributed wind speeds in a farm, taking into account a standard deviation of 1m/s. The normalized instantaneous power produced by a farm is computed using another mathematical equation where f represents the probability density function of the normal distribution. The farm power density is defined by the spacing of the wind turbines, with this study choosing seven times the rotor diameter as the distance between turbines due to wake and shadowing effects of neighboring turbines. Given that the specific power of wind turbines is 247 W/m2, this results in a farm power density of 3.95 MW/km2. For an Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES), its power generation cannot be defined by a machine power curve as its flight altitude varies for optimal power output. Instead, AWES power is a function of the entire vertical wind profile with its optimal flight trajectory dependent on prevailing wind conditions. The study uses a dynamical system model to describe an AWE wing operating on a circular trajectory, influenced by prevailing wind speeds, aerodynamic forces, and control inputs. The article concludes with an optimal control problem (OCP) that maximizes average power generation for one flight orbit for a certain wind profile. This OCP is formulated using a set of mathematical equations that include system states, the algebraic state, and the control inputs as decision variables.
