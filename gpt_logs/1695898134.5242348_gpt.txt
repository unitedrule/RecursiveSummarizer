RESPONSE:

In 2018, the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation of the European Commission commissioned a report to examine the current status of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) in Europe, aiming to guide its public funding strategies for further technological development. The authors of the report employed various investigative methods such as desk research, scoping interviews, stakeholder engagement using semi-structured interviews with 38 stakeholders, focus groups on selected themes, and a validation workshop. The report concluded that AWES technology was still in its infancy and it remained uncertain whether the technology could significantly contribute to the EU's energy supply and decarbonization targets. The authors found that the potential impact of AWES on the energy system was contingent upon the scale of AWES deployment. They noted that small-to-medium scale systems typically target niche markets and are unlikely to significantly impact the EU energy system. However, even if AWES were successfully scaled up, challenges would persist. For safety reasons and a preference to deploy AWES away from populated areas, land-based AWES market entry would likely take place outside densely populated Europe. If deployed within Europe, they might compete for space with conventional wind energy sources, thereby potentially limiting their complementary role. This area requires further research. Offshore AWES would face difficulties due to harsh environments and their operating expenses are anticipated to constitute a larger portion of their total cost compared to conventional wind turbines. Despite these challenges, the authors noted that Europe does hold an industrial leadership position in this technology which could be leveraged as an export advantage even if deployments within Europe are not substantial. The report outlined a detailed phased-gate approach that allows the public sector's risk-controlled participation in AWE development. It proposed several recommendations including: proving continuous operations by defining, achieving, and proving reliability targets; substantiating the AWES case by deepening insight into resource potential and resource complementarity; anchoring learning by building on previous experiences and improving fundamental understanding; and creating a hub by concentrating testing activities in one geographic location. The report emphasized the need for AWES field data to address non-technological barriers such as wildlife impacts, investor confidence, and regulatory approval. It also recommended collaboration with the AWE sector, public funding to help the sector learn from failures, and the exploration of developing a test site by the public sector.
