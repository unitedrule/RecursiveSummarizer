CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article provides a mathematical model of an electricity system, formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem with the target of minimizing total annual system costs. The LP problem is formulated by integrating the problem objective (4), load-supply balance equations (5), capacity limits (6), the constrained area for wind technology installations (7), and the fixed electricity share supplied by Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) (8). The model also includes constraints about hydro power, thermal generation, and emissions. Hydro power storage at any given time is constrained by the water reservoir, maximum power plant capacity, and weather-dependent inflow. The thermal power production technologies are limited by their cycling abilities, which include start-up and minimal load capabilities. The sets, parameters, and variables used in the LP problem are detailed in Table B1. These include sets such as technologies (I), time steps (T), subsets including all wind power technologies and solar PV (T vRES), subsets including all thermal technologies (T th), and time steps comprised in a start-up interval (J). Variables include generation of technology i at time step t (gi, t), installed capacity of technology i (si), active capacity of a technology i at a time t active (gi,t active), cycling cost (cycl k), start-up cost (cstart i,t k), part-load cost (cpart load i,t). The research also lists parameters such as Dt which represents electricity. Further, it presents the internal losses (?int) as 0.885, minimum cp value as 0.18, rotor diameter as 100m, cut-in wind speed as 3m/s, WT generator size as 1.94 MW and cut-out wind speed as 25m/s.
