installed wind capacity globally, so they represent a broad perspective on the state and focus of industry [38]. In September 2020, IEA Wind Task 11 Base Technology Exchange held a two-day topical expert meeting on Airborne Wind Energy. This section summarizes the conclusions of the meeting attendees and the future work proposed through the IEA. This summary draws from meeting presentations and proceedings [37] and the proposed IEA Task for Airborne Wind Energy [39]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Topical Expert Meeting Highlights </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">A topical expert meeting (TEM) is a gathering of world experts to discuss the state of a technology, whether a new IEA Wind Task would be helpful, and if so, what the potential scope should be. The 2020 meeting reviewed for this present report was focused on the global development and deployment of AWES. Dr. Roland Schmehl, Professor at TU Delft, summarized what the group hoped to achieve in the long run:  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Based on its resource availability and material savings, make AWE the cheapest form of energy. Based on its low environmental footprint, make AWE the most acceptable  form of energy. Combine AWE with other renewable energy technologies to  accelerate the transition to a 100% renewable energy system. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The group envisioned a timeline of 13 years to market entry for small-scale AWES (up to several hundred kilowatts) into niche markets and 515 years to market entry for larger-scale AWES (megawatt-range) that can have an impact on the energy system and achieve AWEs full potential [40]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">A session on electrical system requirements noted that AWE electrical systems (generators, power electronics) are challenging for ground-gen systems due to the extremes of operationslow, high torque, reeling-out and fast, low-torque reeling in. The unique oscillating power generation profiles and the energy required to launch and recover fly-gen systems also pose challenges. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Regarding workforce development, finding potential employees, policy makers, and other stakeholders with awareness of AWE is rare. Recent Ph.D. networks like the Airborne Wind Energy System Modelling, Control and Optimization program (AWESCO [41] EU Horizon 2020) and the New Energy and mobility Outlook for the Netherlands (NEON [42] Dutch Research Council) have contributed both to the research literature and supply of experienced engineers for AWE companies. Specialized programs (across educational levels, e.g., BS/MS degree, pilot certification, technician) or massive open online courses could be developed to improve awareness.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The meeting reinforced the idea that a new IEA Wind Task for AWE should be proposed and established four key international R&amp;D topics for working groups to further refine: </P>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Resource potential and markets. The AWE advantage in power generation is the ability to reach better wind higher up, or to reach the same winds with less mass, and to vary the operational altitude to target the best winds, which are not always at the highest altitude. Because of this, defining a power curve requires care and the industry must establish best practices and standards. One presenter raised the concern that if the energy-harvesting characteristics of AWES are not differentiated from traditional wind turbines, the sector cannot expect significant market penetration [15]. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Reference models, tools, and metrics. There are several experimentally validated toolsets within academia for the simulation and design of AWES, but there is a need for more training and dissemination. Third-party (e.g., certification) entities will also need validated and well-understood tools to evaluate AWE technology. Researchers have defined a multi-megawatt (MW) rigid-wing ground-gen reference model, but there is no established effort to develop a reference model for any other configuration. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Safety and regulation. Since AWE consists of flying components, reliability and safety are critically important. The wide variety of AWE architectures (see Section  <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">III</Reference> ) means that the safety concerns are also widely varied, but all have a need for new standards and regulation. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Social acceptance. Because there are no commercial AWE units, the environmental and societal impacts of AWE are known only to the extent that can be modeled or extrapolated from other technologies. This holds for both potentially detrimental (noise, wildlife impact, visual signature) and potentially beneficial (mobility, lifecycle emissions, flexibility in altitude and operation) aspects of the technology. </LBody> </LI> </L>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Proposed International Energy Agency Task </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">With the framework set by the TEM, the meeting organizers developed a task proposal [39] with five work packages (WPs)one for each R&amp;D area described in the previous section, plus a fifth added in January 2021, to be executed over the next three years, if approved by Wind TCP leadership.  </P>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> WP1:  Resource potential and markets </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> WP2:  Reference models, tools, and metrics </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> WP3:  Safety and regulation </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> WP4:  Social acceptance </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> WP5:  AWES architectures (new since TEM) </LBody> </LI> </L>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> The main goal of WP5 is to explore and document the complete design space of AWES architectures and study how they compare in terms of applicability, performance, and impact. The output will also include R&amp;D needs and any found untapped design space. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The WPs described in this section follow logically from the conclusions of the EU 2018 report [36] and the 2020 TEM [37]namely, that AWE is an immature technology far from convergence into a dominant architecture and would need rigorous RD&amp;D including public-sector support to achieve its potential. Resource potential and markets (WP1) are inherently country-specific topics that the United States may study, but the tools and techniques for evaluating this can be improved and standardized through collaboration. Safety and regulation (WP3) and social acceptance (WP4) are two key areas that have seen very little study outside of company- and region-specific research.  </P>  <P id="LinkTarget_886" xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <H2 xml:lang="EN-US">2021 U.S. Airborne Wind Energy Workshop </H2>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Workshop Purpose </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Held virtually in March 2021, the U.S. Airborne Wind Energy Workshop [6] was designed to gather U.S. AWE stakeholders perspectives on the status and potential of AWES to contribute significantly to the U.S. energy system.

Analyses also empirically identify a range of 118 MW/km2 for installed U.S. wind farms, showing that it is plausible to achieve significant variation in installed capacity density [7].

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the conclusions and future work proposed through the IEA Wind Task 11 Base Technology Exchange meeting on Airborne Wind Energy. The meeting aimed to discuss the global development and deployment of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). The group envisioned a timeline of 13 years for small-scale AWES and 515 years for larger-scale AWES to enter the market. Challenges related to electrical systems, workforce development, and social acceptance were also highlighted. The article proposes an International Energy Agency Task with five work packages focusing on resource potential, reference models, safety and regulation, social acceptance, and AWES architectures. Additionally, the U.S. Airborne Wind Energy Workshop gathered perspectives on the status and potential of AWES in the U.S., highlighting the need for more data and modeling on wind resources, research on wildlife and community impacts, public awareness, and experimental test centers. The article concludes by addressing the potential and viability of AWES in the United States compared to traditional wind energy.
