CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article examines the potential of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) compared to traditional Wind Turbines (WT). The findings are visualized through a model that shows the Full Load Hours (FLHs) of AWESs compared to WTs, as displayed in Figure 8. The model demonstrates that AWESs have an advantage in inland and hilly areas compared to coastal and offshore regions. This is consistent with the findings of an earlier study[16], which highlighted the importance of wind shear for the performance of AWESs. It was noted that the greater the wind shear, the more advantageous it is for AWESs due to their ability to harness high-altitude winds and adjust their operation altitude. In locations with similar wind speeds at all altitudes, WTs with lower cut-in wind speeds show a better power yield. The article also discusses the assumptions, limitations, and model choices used in this research. The power generation of wind power systems and optimization of electricity grid are modeled assuming perfect foresight on weather and demand. This assumption primarily affects cases using intensive thermal base load and may underestimate costs of wind integration due to perfect information planning. Two uncertain density factors relevant to the results are considered: available space and AWE farm density. Available space depends on land and airspace regulation and acceptance[9], while AWE farm density depends on safety margin choice, ranging from one system to multiple systems per km2[36][37]. Due to these uncertainties, AWE density is varied by introducing a location-independent density factor ? with values of 10% and 100%. The article suggests that complete space availability is unlikely, but higher farm density can be achieved through sophisticated system control. Higher space availability or higher farm density can be related to the ? 100% case. However, an explicit density case cannot be extracted from this study.
