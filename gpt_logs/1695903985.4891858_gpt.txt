difference to the LAWES case is that due to its large number of FLHs, its installation is economical, even if it becomes more costly than traditional wind.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the distribution and economic feasibility of wind power technologies, specifically Wind Turbines (WTs) and Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES), across different wind classes. Despite a large number of Full Load Hours (FLHs), the installation of AWES is found to be economically viable, even if its cost surpasses that of traditional wind power. However, the total share of wind power does not exceed 50%, with AWES replacing traditional wind in class 4. The allocation of WTs and AWES across various wind speed areas is also examined. WTs are generally installed in high wind-speed areas, while AWES are designated for low wind-speed areas. An exception to this is seen in very low-cost AWE scenarios where AWES is present in class 5 wind speeds. Regardless, this area is generally assigned to traditional WTs if they contribute to total electricity production. A share of AWE is found to be useful at all modelled cost levels, but high wind-speed sites are invariably equipped with WTs. The FLHs of each technology are mapped over the SE2 region. High FLHs do not necessarily indicate good performance at low wind speeds as they might be achieved by production concentrated on medium and high wind speed hours. Coastal sites and Lake V?nern at location N59'E13', for example, present equally good sites for all systems with similar FLHs. However, these areas would relate to class five wind speeds and thus be ideal for WTs. Northern sites show fewer FLHs for WTs but higher FLHs for AWES, making them more suitable for lower wind classes and AWES allocation. The article also includes figures demonstrating the optimal annual energy mix for SE2 and a map showing the average FLHs for each technology across the SE2 region (Figures 6 & 7). These figures illustrate how different wind power technologies are allocated and compete across various wind classes and areas.
