CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses a research project set to commence in January 2021 for a duration of three years, pending approval from Wind TCP leadership. The research project is divided into five work packages (WPs), namely: WP1 (Resource potential and markets), WP2 (Reference models, tools, and metrics), WP3 (Safety and regulation), WP4 (Social acceptance), and WP5 (AWES architectures). WP5 aims to explore and document the complete design space of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) architectures, comparing their applicability, performance, and impact. The output will include research & development needs and any untapped design space. The project arises from the conclusions of the EU 2018 report [36] and the 2020 TEM [37], which state that Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an immature technology that requires rigorous RD&D, including public-sector support. The study of resource potential and markets (WP1) is country-specific, but can be standardized through collaboration. Safety and regulation (WP3) and social acceptance (WP4) are areas that have seen little study outside company- and region-specific research. In March 2021, a virtual workshop titled "2021 U.S. Airborne Wind Energy Workshop" was held to gather perspectives on the status and potential of AWES in the U.S energy system. The Department of Energy sponsored the workshop as part of its response to the Congressional AWE inquiry. Hosted by NREL, it included around 100 attendees from various sectors. The workshop comprised three speakers, a panel discussion on AWE research and development status, followed by breakout sessions discussing five categories: resource potential and energy output; technical potential, social and environmental impacts, and permitting; techno-economic analysis and markets; technology assessment and upscaling; demonstration and commercialization needs. Key takeaways from the workshop highlighted several areas of concern: technical potential and techno-economic analysis are sensitive to assumptions with high uncertainty; discussions on higher-altitude wind resource must consider tether length and elevation angle; more data and modeling are required on the wind resource above 200m; research on wildlife and community impacts is scarce; public knowledge or understanding of AWE's functional and economic attributes is limited.
