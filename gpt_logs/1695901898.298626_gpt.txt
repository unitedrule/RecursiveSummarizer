RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the modeling and optimization of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). The study utilizes a mathematical model that includes position, velocity, rotation, angular velocity, surface controls, and energy as algebraic states (x), tether constraints as algebraic states (z), changes in surface controls and the drag force of on-board propellers as control inputs (u), and wind data as parameters (p). The cost functional ?( ) (3a) is used to maximize power generation and regularize control inputs. Flight dynamics are described using system function (3b). Constraints enforce periodicity of flight trajectory (3c) and introduce physical system bounds per AWES physics (3d). Two AWES systems are considered - a large AWES (LAWES) with 2 MW power and 40 m wing span, and a small AWES (sAWES) with 0.6 MW power and 28 m wing span. These systems are modeled on Makani wings. The optimization problem is highly nonlinear and requires repeated solving for each hour's wind profile to generate an annual hourly electricity generation profile. A time-efficient numerical method is proposed to solve this problem, which exploits similarities between consecutive solutions resulting from similar wind profiles. A regression model is also used to approximate the mapping between wind data and power generation. The study assumes that the distance between individual systems within a farm is defined by the maximum tether length set to 500 m. The total space needed is a dome with a radius of the tether length measured from the ground station, resulting in an AWE farm power density of ?P,sAWE 0:6 and ?P;LAWE 2MW= km. Wind classes are used to reduce data points in the optimization problem. Generation profiles are grouped into five classes based on average wind speeds at an altitude of 100 m. Each grid point is assigned a class based on its average wind speeds, implying that each class collects a certain land surface area. This simplification assumes that wind power installations are evenly distributed across each class and that there is no grid congestion within the region.
