RESPONSE:

The research article delves into the calculation of the share of annual electricity demand supplied by Airborne Wind Energy (AWE). The annual marginal system value c0(?) is first obtained and mathematically expressed as ?ctot??? ctot?? ?0:05? ctot?? 0:05?, where ?ctot??? is the change in total electricity system cost and ?s(?) is the change in installed AWE capacity at an AWE share ? of the regional annual electricity demand. The share ? is increased from 0 to 1 in discrete steps of 0.1. The total AWE generation is constrained to a fixed share ? of the regional annual demand to obtain the value of c0(?) from the model. The cost for AWE power generation is set to zero, implying that AWE is a free power source. Therefore, as the share ? increases, AWE capacity s (?) also increases, resulting in lower total system costs ctot??). The change in costs ?c can then be related to the AWE's value in the system. From another perspective, ?ctot??? is the willingness to pay for extra installed AWE capacity at a certain share ?. The costs are visualized as projected initial investments rather than annual costs, dividing the annual marginal system costs of Equation (9) by the annuity factor AF gives rise to the marginal system value MSV(?) as MSV???c0??? with AF r 11 , ?10?. The study was carried out for four characteristic regions: Ireland (a windy region), south-central Sweden (a windy and hydro-dominated region), central Spain (a low wind but sunny region), and Hungary (a region with medium wind and solar radiation). These regions were chosen to demonstrate differences in renewable energy resources impact. By 2050, an electrification of the industrial sector is assumed, resulting in an estimated 22.5% increase in the annual electricity demand compared to today's levels as per ENTSO-E (2017)49. The resulting electricity demand per region is listed in Tables 2 and 3. The available area and total power density of AWE systems depend on several factors, including the power density of a wind farm and social factors. The value of MSV(?) corresponds to the upper limit of the combined investment and fixed O&M costs of a cost-competitive Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES). The interest rate r is 0.05, and the expected AWE lifetime is t 30.
