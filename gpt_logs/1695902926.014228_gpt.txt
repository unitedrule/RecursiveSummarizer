RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the potential and challenges of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). The large-scale deployment of this technology is contingent on its costs and electricity generation capabilities relative to other technologies. This has been analyzed using reanalyses wind data resources and Lidar wind speed measurements at the location of Pritzwalk to estimate mid-altitude wind conditions and compute optimal power production. The economic potential of AWES is often evaluated using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), with estimates suggesting that AWES could offer electricity at a lower LCOE compared to conventional wind turbines. The estimated LCOE for AWES ranges between 33 and 150 M= Wh, indicating high uncertainty in the actual costs. Beyond costs, the electricity generation profile or distribution over time is also crucial. A study by Malz et al computed the optimal power generation profile for AWES and traditional wind turbines using MERRA-2 wind data from different locations, finding similarities particularly in areas with low wind shear. Despite assessments on wind data for AWES operation, power generation, and economic potential, the role of AWE as part of the larger electricity system has not been thoroughly analyzed. This includes understanding how AWES units interact with other power production technologies in the system, as a generation profile that correlates with the system's net load holds high economic value.
