CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article is centered around an electricity system model that incorporates five Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) electricity generation profiles of all wind classes as well as five Wind Turbine (WT) profiles. This model is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and is developed in GAMS, using the CPLEX solver. The model was originally created by Gansson et al. as a tool to study thermal power plant cycling. The primary decision variables in the LP problem are the regional installed capacity (s) of each technology and the hourly electricity generation (g). The model mandates that the total electricity generation from all technologies must meet the hourly regional load at the lowest possible annual system cost, while also achieving net-zero CO2 emissions. The model operates under a green-field study assumption, meaning it does not consider any pre-existing power plant installations. The goal is to explore the dynamic of a potential system with net-zero CO2 emissions, rather than predicting future electricity system compositions. Therefore, the green-field model is deemed appropriate. The time resolution of the model is three-hourly, and it assumes perfect foresight while neglecting distribution losses and ancillary services. Its focus is on capturing the variability aspect of wind and solar power, but it does not account for losses or uncertainty. The geographical scope of this study includes four regions: Ireland (IE), Hungary (HU), south-central Sweden (SE2), and central Spain (ES3). Each region is modeled independently, without considering import or export of electricity. In terms of mathematical formulation, the main equations of the LP problem include an objective function that minimizes annual system cost for investment and dispatch, a constraining generation-load balance equation, and a capacity-limiting generation equation. In these equations, ctot represents total annual system cost; si denotes installed capacity; gi,t signifies generation at time step t; I represents the set of included technologies; T denotes the set of time steps (every third hour of the year); Cinv is the initial investment cost per technology; and AFi is the annuity factor, which is dependent on the technical lifetime of a technology. Lastly, the study includes a table that outlines the technologies incorporated in the model results, which include AWE systems of wind class 1,2,3,4,5 and onshore wind energy systems of wind class 1,2,3,4,5.
