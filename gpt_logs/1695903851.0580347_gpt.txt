RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the comparison between small Airborne Wind Energy Systems (sAWES) and Large Airborne Wind Energy Systems (LAWES), particularly focusing on Full Load Hours (FLHs), Marginal System Value (MSV), profile value, and power density. The sAWES has a significantly higher number of FLHs than the LAWES due to its greater area-to-weight ratio of the power-producing wing, which is also closely linked to its higher MSV. The sAWES also has a better profile value than the LAWES, meaning it has a more evenly distributed power throughout the year with fewer zero production hours. This more constant power profile results in less costly thermal peak power generation, thus improving the overall system value. The difference in profile value has an impact on the final energy mix. For example, in the SE2 region, the electricity production by thermal technologies is up to 13% higher for LAWES compared to sAWES. However, the power density of sAWES is three times lower than that of LAWES, making it less efficient when local area restriction becomes a limiting factor. In scenarios such as sAWE-10% and LAWE-10%, high electricity shares cannot be achieved due to lack of installation sites. The four key factors affecting the competition between AWE and traditional Wind Turbines (WTs) are identified as being crucial in determining cost-optimal allocation of technologies among wind classes within a region. The trend shows it is cost-optimal to allocate AWE capacity to lowest wind-speed classes that have WTs installed and replace WTs in that class. In windy regions like SE2 and IE, these are classes 2-4. However, in poor wind regions like HU and ES3, WTs are only installed in class 5, where AWESs are also allocated. This method of allocation takes advantage of the higher FLHs of AWESs relative to WTs and leaves high wind-speed sites to the WTs, which show more uniform power generation. The findings are visualized in Figures 4 and 5, which respectively illustrate FLHs per class for each region and technology, and thermal generation in the SE2 region for all AWES cases.
