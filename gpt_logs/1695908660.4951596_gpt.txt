RESPONSE:

The research article explores the impact of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) on thermal power generation. The study uses the Marginal System Value (MSV) to highlight the competition between wind technologies and thermal power generation. When AWES replaces conventional Wind Turbines (WT), it results in a constant MSV, as the total wind power generation remains more or less constant. At lower Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) shares, the MSV remains almost flat for windy areas of SE2 (for ? < 0.6) and IE (for ? < 0.3). This is because AWES repeatedly replaces WTs of a specific wind class within a 0.1-interval of ?, implying that the total wind power generation in the system is relatively constant. With each ?-step, the additional energy from AWE reduces the need for the same amount of WT capacity (?s), accompanied by an identical change in cost (?ctot), resulting in a constant MSV. At higher AWE shares, the system becomes saturated, and the MSV declines more drastically due to technology outcompeting itself. When the capacity of AWE is increased beyond a certain point, there is such an extent of fluctuation in total electricity generation that wind power generation gets curtailed. Consequently, thermal base generation (mainly nuclear and bio+natural gas CCS) gets pushed out, and hourly generation then consists of variable wind and solar power generation and costly thermal peak generation. The study further explores this relationship by showcasing thermal generation in regions SE2 and HU for LAWES at ? = 100% in Figure 3. As AWE share increases, thermal peak power generation (biogas GT and biogas CCGT) increases while thermal base load technologies (nuclear and bio+natural gas CCS) decrease. This indicates an increasing variability of power supply in the electricity system. The increase in electricity supplied by peak power generation is costly, leading to a decline in MSV of AWE. During the gradual replacement of WTs by AWESs at low shares, the peak power generation increases only slightly, indicating a constant electricity share by wind energy and higher generation variability of AWESs compared to WTs. Beyond ? 0:6, the electricity system becomes more saturated with general wind energy, leading to a significant decline in thermal base production and an increase in thermal peak production. Consequently, total thermal power generation drops due to the increased energy supply by wind power technologies and system saturation. In less windy regions like HU, the drop in all thermal production technologies and wind energy saturation occurs at lower AWE shares because of low wind resources. While there are slight differences across modelled regions, the general trend is similar for all regions. In rare cases (as shown in Figure 2C for sAWE-100%), an increase in MSV occurs. This happens when AWE capacity is installed in low wind-speed classes at low shares, while at higher shares, capacity shifts to high wind-speed classes. This allows the same amount of energy to be generated with less installed capacity because installations shift to high wind-speed classes.
