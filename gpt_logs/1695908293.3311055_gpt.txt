To reduce the number of data points and thus the model size, generation profiles are grouped into five wind classes. The simplification implies the assumption that wind power installations are geographically evenly distributed across each wind class and that there is no grid congestion within the investigated region. The five wind classes are defined by the percentiles of the average wind speeds at an altitude of 100 m. Each grid point is correspondingly assigned to a class dependent on its average wind speeds at 100 m, implying that each wind class collects a certain land surface area.

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the optimization of airborne wind energy systems (AWES) based on parametric models, wind data and a cost functional equation. The control inputs in the model include the change of surface controls and the drag force of the on-board propellers. The cost functional equation aims to maximize the average power generation of one trajectory during the orbit time while regularizing the control inputs. The model also includes constraints that enforce periodicity of the flight trajectory and introduce physical system bounds determined by the physics of AWES. Two possible AWES systems are considered, both aligned to the Makani wings. These are a large AWES (LAWES) with 2 MW (40 m wing span) and a small AWES (sAWES) with 0.6 MW (28 m wing span). The optimization control problem (OCP) is highly nonlinear making it challenging to solve. However, a time-efficient numerical method has been proposed in previous studies which exploits the similarity between consecutive OCP solutions resulting from different wind profiles. The study assumes that the distance between individual systems within a farm is defined by maximum tether length, set to 500m. This results in an AWE farm power density of ?P,sAWE 0:6 and ?P;LAWE 2MW= km, respectively. The study presents an annual hourly electricity generation profile for each spatial grid point using available wind data and normal distribution of wind speeds within a wind farm. This is grouped into five wind classes to simplify data points and reduce model size. Each class is defined by percentiles of average wind speeds at an altitude of 100m. The assumption is that wind power installations are evenly distributed across each class without grid congestion within the investigated region.
