The capacity installation and electricity production are optimized such that the demand is met at minimal costs and power plant constraints are fulfilled. This work is inspired by Gansson,22 which uses a similar model to investigate the MSVs for different wind turbine designs.

RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on optimizing the capacity installation and electricity production to meet demand at minimal costs while also adhering to power plant constraints. This work builds upon Gansson's model which investigates the Marginal System Values (MSVs) for different wind turbine designs and is also a follow-up study to Malz et al's comparison of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) and Wind Turbines (WTs) generation profiles. The article structure consists of five sections. Section 2 details the wind data, wind power generation technology models, and the electricity system optimization model, also summarizing the studied scenarios. The results are presented in Section 3, discussed in Section 4, and concluded in Section 5. The method involves obtaining high-resolution wind data from ERA-5 wind data from ECMWF for all analyzed regions for the full year of 2012. The AWES model requires wind data at multiple altitudes to generate a vertical wind profile. The altitude levels close to the ground are considered, providing 15 relevant vertical wind speed data points at each time and spatial instance. Wind speed data are processed into a family of smooth polynomial functions of altitude to estimate the wind speeds for the WT at the height of 100 m and provide a vertical wind profile function to the AWES model. This procedure is thoroughly explained in prior work. The paper then transitions to converting wind power to electricity for an accurate potential assessment of the two different wind power technologies.
