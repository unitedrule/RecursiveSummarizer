CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1980, researcher Miles Loyd studied the use of kites as an alternative to horizontal axis wind turbines, which he called airborne wind energy. However, at that time, sensor technology and control methods were not advanced enough for commercial development. Since the early 2000s, there has been significant development in airborne wind energy systems (AWES) by a global community of advocates, researchers, and businesses. This report outlines the potential and technical viability of AWES in the United States, as directed by the Energy Act of 2020. It also discusses the research and development needed to demonstrate the viability of this industry over the next decade. The report excludes concepts that focus on telecommunication or observation rather than electricity production. Section III provides an overview of AWE technology, including benefits, challenges, design choices, historical context, and global market leaders. Section IV summarizes recent reports on the European Union's market outlook for AWE, a technical experts meeting of the International Energy Agency (IEA) regarding AWE, and a U.S. Airborne Wind Energy workshop. Section V discusses the challenges and opportunities facing the U.S. AWE market, including potential resources, technology viability, research needs, development barriers, and commercialization barriers. The report concludes with Section VI, which discusses the role of future research in achieving the potential of airborne wind energy. AWE is fundamentally different from traditional wind energy, and Table 1 highlights the differences between them.
