CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article presents the representative data within wind classes and the analysis of the marginal system value (MSV) of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) in four different modelled regions. The wind resources vary across regions, with wind speeds in class five in low-wind regions (HU, ES3) equal to wind speeds in low classes for high-wind areas (SE2, IE). The MSV for the four regions and four AWES cases, the sAWES and LAWES with ? 0:1 and 1, respectively, are shown. A reference MSV of 1541 k= MW is represented by a horizontal grey dashed line, equalling the cost of a representative 2MW wind turbine, including capital cost (1290 k= MW) and projected O&M cost for an average full load hours (FLH) for 30 years of operation. In the modelled cases, the MSV of AWE goes up to MSV?? 0?2:2M= MW(SE2). This implies that AWES may cost 150% of a wind turbine but still be valuable to the electricity system. The MSV(0) point describes the case of AWE entering the electricity system with its very first units. The MSV of AWES varies between regions, ranging at low electricity share levels from 1.3 to 2.2 = MW and at high shares from 0.4 to 1 M= MW. The Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE) can be estimated for individual MSV levels by multiplying the MSV with the annuity factor and dividing by respective annual FLHs. This results in a range of 3545 = MWh for low share levels, representing the maximal cost-competitive LCOE in the modelled electricity system. This is compared to an estimated range of 33 = MWh and 150 = MWh in previous studies. The MSV level for different modelled cases is determined by four factors: the AWE share of power generation, the power density (MW= km) of the AWESs, the AWE FLHs, and the temporal distribution of the AWE power generation, also known as the profile value. The study further discusses the impact of AWE share on the MSV. With an increasing share of AWE capacity in the electricity system, there's a general declining trend of the MSV in all regions. This is due to three reasons: gradual replacement of wind turbines by AWESs, increased need for thermal peak generation to manage the generation-load balance, and/or the electricity system gradually becoming saturated with wind.
