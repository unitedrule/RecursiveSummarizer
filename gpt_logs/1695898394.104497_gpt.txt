CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems could potentially be deployed within utility-scale solar plants to complement their diurnal nature. However, these applications are hypothetical and may introduce new challenges such as difficult flying in the wake of a traditional wind turbine, property risks from overflying a solar installation, and the dense spacing of older wind farms. In terms of offshore applications, AWE's theoretical attributes such as low wake losses, smaller and cheaper support structures, and the ability to install and maintain them without needing expensive large service vessels could make it a compelling area for further research and development. Approximately 58 percent of the U.S. offshore wind resource is in water deeper than 60m requiring floating platforms for conventional wind turbines. The floating platform is the largest capital expenditure component of Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for floating wind; therefore, AWE may have an advantage in deeper waters if they can operate from significantly smaller platforms or with lower mooring requirements. However, these beneficial attributes have yet to be demonstrated onshore or offshore. The smaller scale (in MW per unit) predicted for initial offshore AWE installations may necessitate more units to be installed in an area to generate the same rated capacity, potentially leading to conflicts with other ocean users and stakeholders. In the United States, where offshore projects are planned with relatively constant spacing between turbines (~1 nautical mile grid) for navigation and co-use purposes, it may be challenging for AWE to achieve the same capacity densities as traditional wind. The contribution of AWE in the offshore space will be sensitive to the scaling potential of AWE concepts to higher capacity per platform, through unit scale or multiple kites, and to the industry's ability to demonstrate reliability over thousands of launch/generate/land sequences. Initial techno-economic analysis for the U.S. market has focused on onshore deployment and found that the results are sensitive to various uncertain inputs including setbacks, tether length, system performance, operational expenses, and achievable AWE array capacity density. The uncertainty can be attributed to the lack of megawatt-scale products or commercial deployments to base the analysis on, and the wide range of AWE designs, performance, operational strategies, and cost projections found in literature. As more data becomes available and tools for modeling system cost and performance evolve, this analysis could be extended and periodically revisited with a focus on national and regional cost and feasibility studies to evaluate key cost drivers, market potential (including offshore), and operational strategies of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). Wind energy developers and researchers have spent significant amounts to characterize the planetary boundary layer up to the tip heights of existing wind turbines (~200m), but there is still great uncertainty in the dynamics of the shears, veers, and turbulence at those elevations. AWES may fly much higher (primarily 200-800m) where quality field data are even more scarce. Developers and policymakers need accurate wind resource data to make design and investment decisions, suggesting a need for multiple long-term measurement campaigns, including at least one located offshore, and refinement of mesoscale modeling techniques.
