RESPONSE:

The text discusses the potential of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) technology and its potential implications for the United States. It underlines the importance of public-sector support for AWE companies, which would provide not only financial assistance but also lend credibility to this emerging industry. The specific needs for technology research and development vary significantly depending on the technology archetype and targeted markets. It is suggested that the creation and operational support of an experimental test center for AWE technology would accelerate industry progress. The text also mentions unquantified potential benefits of AWE such as portability, low material inputs, viewshed, co-use of existing grid interconnections. The following section addresses requests from Congress regarding the potential and technical viability of AWES to provide a significant source of energy in the United States, a summary of RD&D needs, and a summary of commercialization needs. A notional 10-year schedule of activities relevant to these discussions is proposed. The potential and viability of AWE are explored in relation to traditional wind energy. The resource potential of airborne wind is likely similar in magnitude to traditional wind potential in the U.S. NREL analysis alongside AWE community feedback suggests a range of conceptual AWES with capacity densities from 0.44 MW/km2 to 19.6 MW/km2 based on tether length, rated power, and system architecture assumptions. This leads to a wide range of technical resource potential for both traditional wind and AWE, both having significant technical resource potential on par with or exceeding the total U.S. electricity generation capacity of 1.2 terawatts. The text discusses how wind speed increases with altitude up to ~300m in many U.S locations but becomes flat up to 500m. Factors such as increased tether length and elevation angle that can reduce these gains are considered. The value of AWE may be derived from areas with low wind, high shear, or high terrain complexity. Malz's study is referenced, which found that AWE is most valuable to the electricity system if installed at sites with low wind speed within a region. The study suggests that even if AWES could demonstrate lower costs compared to wind turbines, AWE would merely substitute for them instead of increasing the total share of wind energy in the system. The study used only one AWE design concept (fly-gen) and focused specifically on onshore deployments in Europe. Therefore, additional AWE concepts and the U.S. context (including offshore) could be studied for a more complete perspective on this issue.
