CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the development and progress of airborne wind energy (AWE) technology. It mentions the design of a pumping mill that served as the basis for many AWE concepts. The research led to the establishment of two spinoff companies and a global network of AWE researchers and enthusiasts. The article also highlights the difference in the number of AWE players between the United States and Europe. The airborne wind community has been organizing annual international conferences since 2009, with delegates from 21 countries attending the 2019 conference. The commercial status and funding of AWE are discussed, with Europe having more players due to stronger public sector support. Currently, only one company globally has shipped a commercial product, but others expect to do so within 15 years. Most companies focus on distributed, remote, or microgrid applications and have plans to scale up by 2030. In terms of funding, European organizations have awarded AWE grants of approximately $58M since 2008, while federal entities in the United States have invested around $13M in AWE technology development. Additionally, there has been significant investment in kite-like devices for underwater energy harvesting. European funding for AWE has been four times higher than in the United States between 2010 and 2020. The article reviews three efforts that assess the state of the AWE market: an EU-commissioned report on commercializing AWE in Europe, an expert meeting on international collaboration, and a U.S.-centric airborne wind workshop. These resources provide consistent conclusions and recommendations that will be further discussed in Section V of the report.
