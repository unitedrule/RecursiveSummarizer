CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

As the provided text does not include a complete research article, it's impossible to summarize it based on the given points. The text appears to be a list of references from various sources, including books, patents, conferences, and online publications. These sources cover topics like offshore wind energy, wind studies and power curves, airborne wind energy, and the history of power kites. However, without the full research article, we can't determine the purpose of the research, the research question, the problem or issue the research is trying to solve, the scope of the research, who participated in it, what approach or method was used, what key results were obtained, any limitations noted by the authors, any implications of the research according to the authors, or how significant the findings are.
