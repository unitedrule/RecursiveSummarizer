altitude is not constant, but varies for optimal power output. Thus, the AWES power is a function of the entire vertical wind profile and the optimal flight trajectory is dependent on the prevailing wind conditions. There exist different approaches of estimating the power production of an AWES, using static, quasi-steady or dynamic models of the AWES.2732 In this study, the model is formulated in the form of a dynamical system, and both the flight trajectory and the average power of the AWES are maximized for each wind profile. The system describes the AWE wing operating on a circular trajectory. The wing is modelled as a rigid body that is influenced by the prevailing wind speeds, the corresponding aerodynamic forces and control inputs. The method and the entire dynamical system is described in detail in previous studies.18,33 As the power generation depends on the wind speeds at the current flight altitude, the dynamical system is implemented in an optimal control problem (OCP) that maximizes the average power generation of one flight orbit for a certain wind profile.

RESPONSE:

The study focuses on optimizing the power output of an Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES) through dynamic modeling and optimal control problem formulation. The AWES power is determined by the vertical wind profile, which further influences the optimal flight trajectory. Different approaches for estimating AWES power production are considered, such as static, quasi-steady, or dynamic models. In this case, the model is formulated as a dynamical system that maximizes both the flight trajectory and the average power of the AWES per wind profile. The AWE wing operation is modeled on a circular trajectory, with the wing as a rigid body affected by wind speeds, aerodynamic forces, and control inputs. This dynamical system is then implemented into an optimal control problem (OCP) that maximizes the average power generation of one flight orbit for a specific wind profile. The OCP is formulated as: min ??x,z,u,p,T??3a?, x;z;u, s:t: F?x_,x,z,u,p,T?0, ?3b?, x?0?,x?T?0, ?3c?, h?x,z,u,p,T?? 0, ?3d?. The decision variables in this equation include system states x &#8; ?22 (position, velocity, rotation, angular velocity, surface controls and energy), algebraic state z &#8; ?1 (related to the algebraic tether constraint), and control inputs u &#8; ?4 (change of surface controls and drag force of on-board propellers). The parameters p include wind data. The cost functional (3a) maximizes average power generation during one trajectory in orbit time T while regularizing control inputs. System function (3b) describes flight dynamics. Constraints (3c) enforce periodicity of flight trajectory and (3d) introduces physical system bounds given by the physics of AWES. Two possible AWES systems are considered in the absence of a commercial one: a large AWES (LAWES) with 2 MW power output and a 40 m wing span, and a small AWES (sAWES) with 0.6 MW power output and a 28 m wing span. Both systems are aligned to Makani wings parameters. The OCP is highly nonlinear and challenging to solve. A time-efficient numerical method for solving the large number of OCPs required for generating an annual hourly electricity generation profile is proposed, utilizing consecutive OCP solutions from different but similar wind profiles. This methodology is based on previous studies referenced as 16, 19, 25, 33, 34, and 35 in the original text.
