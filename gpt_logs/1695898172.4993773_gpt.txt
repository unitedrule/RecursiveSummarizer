CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the development and deployment of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) in Europe and the United States. It suggests that a European test site for AWES should be established, with input from the sector on requirements such as 24/7 operation approval, lower testing fees, wind resource data, and grid connectivity. It also highlights the importance of investing in enabling technologies such as automation, composite materials, and drone technology that have already benefitted AWES development. The document emphasizes the need for building mutual trust through setting realistic expectations and offering a conditional outlook of stable support. It suggests that developers should communicate their timelines and milestones to the public sector, allowing for a clear rationale for public funding. This communication can also help the public sector provide a stable funding outlook with clear expectations of what support is available when performance metrics are achieved. The text further highlights that many of these findings could be applicable to the U.S. market, despite differences such as a delay in offshore wind deployment relative to Europe, a lack of wind energy penetration in the southeast United States, lower population density, and differences in airspace regulatory environment. It notes that the U.S. does not hold an industrial or technological leadership position in AWES and is therefore unlikely to benefit from exporting this technology. In terms of international cooperation, the text refers to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which runs Technology Collaboration Programs (TCPs) to promote cooperation and accelerate energy technology development. The U.S. takes part in these TCPs with its National Laboratories leading or co-leading several projects on topics such as systems engineering, blade recycling, wind farm control, and forecasting. In September 2020, IEA Wind Task 11 Base Technology Exchange held a two-day topical expert meeting on Airborne Wind Energy. The meeting was attended by representatives from countries with more than 85 percent of installed global wind capacity. The meeting aimed to discuss the state of AWES technology and potential scope for a new IEA Wind Task. The long-term goal, as summarized by Dr. Roland Schmehl, Professor at TU Delft, is to make AWES the cheapest and most acceptable form of energy due to its resource availability, material savings, and low environmental footprint. The aim is also to combine AWES with other renewable energy technologies to accelerate the transition to a 100% renewable energy system.
