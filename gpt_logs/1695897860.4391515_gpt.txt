CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the intermittent support for U.S. Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) Research and Development (R&D) which has received approximately $13 million since 2009. In contrast, the European Union (EU) has actively supported AWE with roughly $58 million since 2008, leading to most AWE advancements occurring in the EU. The authors suggested various research, development, demonstration, and commercialization (RDD&C) activities over a projected 10-year period to advance and validate the technical and economic feasibility of AWE systems. This could be achieved through a phased-gate approach, which sets expectations for progress at each stage before advancing to the next investment phase. A proposed RDD&C plan could incorporate several elements and activities: 1. Understanding the quantity, quality, and complementary nature of wind resources above traditional wind turbines, specifically above 200 meters. 2. Undertaking national and regional cost and feasibility studies to assess key cost drivers, market potential (including offshore), and economic benefits of AWE technology. 3. Enhancing the physical understanding of different AWE concepts through modeling and simulation with a focus on power density, robust controls, and scaling potential. 4. Establishing test facilities and research capacities to allow AWE system developers to validate system and sub-system reliability and performance, as well as studying grid/micro-grid integration. 5. Encouraging industry R&D by facilitating access to research and engineering talent at National Laboratories through cooperative research and development agreements or other mechanisms. 6. Participating in standards-setting organizations to contribute to the establishment of international standards for AWE design, testing, and certification. 7. Assessing social acceptance and environmental implications of AWE technology while quantifying environmental and human impacts where possible. 8. Attracting and developing talent for the AWE industry through research fellowships, centers of excellence, prize competitions, and other training mechanisms. 9. Exploring options for cost-effective policies and technical assistance mechanisms for the development and commercialization of AWE technology. The authors emphasized that all these elements are integral to the whole concept, with their relative priority and timing over a 10-year period determined by the desired commercial timeline, availability of funding from various sources, and the targeted AWE market.
