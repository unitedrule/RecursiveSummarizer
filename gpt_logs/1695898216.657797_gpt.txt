CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research group proposed a timeline of 13 years for the market entry of small-scale Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) with a capacity of several hundred kilowatts, targeting niche markets. Larger-scale AWES with megawatt-range are expected to enter the market and have an impact on the energy system in 15-15 years, thus achieving AWES's full potential. The group noted challenges in AWES's electrical system requirements such as ground-gen systems, which face difficulties due to extreme operations like low, high torque, reeling-out, and fast, low-torque reeling in. The oscillating power generation profiles and the energy required to launch and recover fly-gen systems also pose challenges. In terms of workforce development, there is a lack of potential employees, policy makers, and other stakeholders aware of AWE. Recent Ph.D. networks such as the Airborne Wind Energy System Modelling, Control and Optimization program (AWESCO EU Horizon 2020) and the New Energy and mobility Outlook for the Netherlands (NEON Dutch Research Council) have contributed to both research literature and a supply of experienced engineers for AWE companies. The development of specialized programs across educational levels or massive open online courses could improve awareness. The meeting emphasized the idea of proposing a new International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Task for AWE, establishing four key international R&D topics for further refinement: Resource potential and markets; Reference models, tools, and metrics; Safety and regulation; Social acceptance. The first topic highlighted that AWE's advantage lies in its ability to reach better wind at higher altitudes or with less mass. The second topic noted that while there are several validated toolsets for AWES simulation and design within academia, more training and dissemination are needed. The third topic underscored the importance of safety and regulation due to AWE's flying components. The last topic emphasized understanding the environmental and societal impacts of AWE, both potentially detrimental (noise, wildlife impact, visual signature) and potentially beneficial (mobility, lifecycle emissions, flexibility in altitude and operation). Finally, the meeting organizers developed a task proposal with five work packages for each R&D area described previously, setting the framework for a proposed International Energy Agency Task.
