RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on the potential change in annual total electricity system cost with respect to the change in installed capacity of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs). The Marginal System Value (MSV) is computed to estimate the maximum cost of technology for being economically viable in a future emission-free electricity system. The study utilizes emission constraints and technology costs corresponding to 2050 projections, optimizing capacity installation and electricity production to meet demand at minimal costs and fulfill power plant constraints. The article is influenced by previous work from Gansson22 and Malz et al16, which investigated MSVs for different wind turbine designs and compared AWESs and Wind Turbines (WTs) in terms of their generation profiles respectively. The results from this research could guide further development and investment in AWE technology. The research methodology involves describing the wind data, wind power generation technology models, the electricity system optimization model, and summarizing the studied scenarios. High-resolution wind data from ECMWF23 for all analyzed regions are used, with data acquired for 2012. The AWES model requires wind data at multiple altitudes to generate a vertical wind profile. The study also considers available altitude levels close to ground, obtaining 15 relevant vertical wind speed data points at each time and spatial instance. The wind speeds are given as u and v, corresponding to East/West and North/South wind speeds. This data is processed into a family of smooth polynomial functions of the altitude, which is required to estimate the wind speeds for the WT at a height of 100 m as well as provide a vertical wind profile function to the AWES model. The two different wind power technologies' power generation is computed with a WT model and an AWES model. In a large wind farm, it's assumed that instantaneous wind speeds have local differences and are normally distributed over the farm with a standard deviation of 1m/s26. The effect on the wind farm power output is also considered in the research.
