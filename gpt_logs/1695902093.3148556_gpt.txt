RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the Marginal System Value (MSV) of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) using an electricity system model. This model is an optimization problem that explores the combination of electricity generation technologies that can meet electricity demand at the lowest cost. The decision variables of the model include investments in electricity generation capacity and the three-hourly generation. The study uses this model to investigate the MSV of AWESs, given that the costs of AWESs are uncertain and investment cost data is unavailable. The available capacity of AWESs is fixed in the model to supply a certain percentage of the annual electricity demand, while the capacity installed for other technologies are decision variables. The MSV represents the change in electricity system cost with respect to an incremental change to the predefined fixed installed AWE capacity. The MSV is obtained by step-wise increasing the fixed AWE capacity between model runs, leading to less installed capacity by other technologies and thus changes in investment and variable costs of the electricity system. The MSV is computed for different AWE shares because it varies greatly with the share of electricity supplied by the technology under analysis. To calculate the MSV for a specific AWE share, first, the annual marginal system value c0(?) is obtained using mathematical equations. The share ? is increased from 0 to 1 in discrete steps of 0.1. Larger AWE shares entail AWE curtailment due to excessive supply at certain hours of the year. To obtain c0(?) from the model, total AWE generation is constrained to a fixed share ? of regional annual demand, with AWE power generation cost set to zero. This implies that AWE is a free power source, thus a higher AWE share results in higher AWE capacity and lower total system costs. The change in costs can then be related to the value of AWE in the system. The willingness to pay for extra AWE capacity installed at a certain share is represented by ?ctot???. To visualize costs as initial investments rather than annual costs, the annual marginal system costs are divided by the annuity factor AF to obtain the MSV(?). The MSV(?) corresponds to the upper bound of combined investment and fixed O&M costs of a cost-competitive AWES. The study is performed for four characteristic regions: Ireland, south-central Sweden, central Spain, and Hungary. These regions were chosen due to their varying wind and sun conditions.
