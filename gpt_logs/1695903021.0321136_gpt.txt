RESPONSE:

The paper aims to optimize the capacity installation and electricity production in such a manner that fulfills the demand at minimal costs and meets power plant constraints. The work is influenced by Gansson's model that examines the Marginal System Values (MSVs) for diverse wind turbine designs and is a continuation of Malz et al's study that compares Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) and Wind Turbines (WTs) concerning their generation profiles. The research could guide further AWE technology development and investments. The paper is structured into five sections: wind data, wind power generation technology models, and the electricity system optimization model, results, discussion, and conclusion. The methods and data used to obtain different regional electricity systems are described. High-resolution wind data is required for accurate annual electricity generation profiles for both wind power technologies. For this, ERA-5 wind data from ECMWF are used, acquired for 2012. The temporal resolution is hourly, and the horizontal spatial resolution of the data is 0.25 x 0.25 . The AWES model needs wind data at multiple altitudes to generate a vertical wind profile. The vertical wind data are given in 30 model levels (sigma levels), representing a specific geopotential above the surface. Around 15 relevant vertical wind speed data points are considered at each time and spatial instance close to the ground. The wind speeds are given in their meteorological vector convention as u and v, corresponding to East/ West and North/South wind speeds. The wind speed data are processed into a family of smooth polynomial functions of altitude for estimating the wind speeds for the WT at 100 m height and providing a vertical wind profile function to the AWES model. For an accurate potential assessment of the two different wind power technologies, their power generation has to be evaluated. The procedure of transforming raw wind data into a polynomial function is explained in previous work16,25. The paper references the works of Gansson22, Malz et al.16, and ECMWF23.
