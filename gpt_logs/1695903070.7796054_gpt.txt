RESPONSE:

The research article elaborates on the calculation of power output in large wind farms using a Wind Turbine (WT) model and an Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES) model. The authors assume that the instantaneous wind speeds in a large wind farm are normally distributed due to local differences. They use a standard deviation of 1m/s for this study, indicating that the power output of the wind farm is smoother with a higher standard deviation. The power curve of a single turbine is formulated as PWT,ind?vw?, where the rotor diameter is D=100m and the generator size is Pcap=1.94MW. The specific power of the wind turbine is assumed to be 247W/m2. The internal and external losses are ?int 0:885 and ?ext 0:94, respectively. The efficiency cp is a function of the wind speed vw and varies between 0.18 and 0.45. Cut-in and cut-out wind speeds vin and vout are assumed to be 3m/s and 25m/s, respectively. The power of a wind farm is smoothed due to normally distributed wind speeds, using a standard deviation of 1m/s. The normalized instantaneous power produced by a farm is computed as PWT,farm?vw? f?xjvw,?2?PWT,ind?x?dx, where f is the probability density function of the normal distribution. The farm power density ?P, WT of the WT farm is defined by the spacing of the wind turbines. In this study, the distance between turbines is seven times the rotor diameter (7D), which results in a farm power density of 3.95 MW/km2 due to wake and shadowing effects of neighboring turbines. For an AWES model, the power generation cannot be defined by a machine power curve as in traditional turbine models because of its flight characteristics. The power curve is limited to 94% to account for wind farm losses and maintenance downtime. The effects of these calculations on the wind turbine power curve are visualized in Figure 1. The references mentioned in the article include: 22, 26, 30, and 89. Further details about the cp-function can be found in Appendix A1 of the original document.
