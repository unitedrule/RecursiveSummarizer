CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research investigates the potential value of airborne wind energy systems (AWES) to the electricity system by modeling scenarios involving four drag-mode AWES cases. These cases include a large wing with a capacity of 2 MW and a small wing with 0.6 MW, each having a high and low power density factor per land area. The electricity generation profiles of the AWESs are optimized based on the hourly wind conditions at various altitudes. The study further explores the value of AWES in four regions with differing conditions for renewable electricity generation and seasonal distribution of electricity demand. The findings indicate that the marginal system value (MSV) of AWES varies between 1.3 and 2.2 M=MW for low electricity shares, while at high shares, the MSV lies between 0.4 and 1 M=MW. The corresponding Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) range is 3545 MWh, aligning with the lower bound of AWES costs estimated in previous research. However, the introduction of AWES does not increase the total share of wind energy in the electricity system due to similarities in power profiles between Wind Turbines (WT) and AWES. In areas with good wind conditions, AWE's value is highest when replacing traditional WTs on poor wind sites, leaving high-wind sites for traditional WTs. This is due to AWES having more Full Load Hours (FLHs), but less even generation profiles compared to WTs. The study suggests that to achieve a high system value, there should be a focus on high system power density, a high number of FLHs relative to WTs, and low variability in the generation profile throughout the year. These factors positively influence the MSV of AWES and encourage their commercialization. Future work should explore other AWES technologies like pumping-mode systems or multi-kite AWES and extend research to include offshore areas. Furthermore, the electricity system model should also consider the heating and transport sector and storage technologies, as these aspects may impact the economical value of AWES.
