the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). As an example, in13 the economic potential of an AWE park is evaluated using a quasi-steady flight model for the power curve estimation of the AWES. That work and most other studies5,9,14,15 estimate that AWE technology could offer electricity at a lower LCOE compared to conventional wind turbines. The estimates of the LCOE for AWESs range between roughly 33 and 150 M= Wh. The large span indicates that the actual costs are still highly uncertain. Apart from the LCOE, a crucial aspect of a power generation technology is the electricity generation profile, that is, the distribution of the electricity production in time. The work in Malz et al16 computes the optimal power generation profile of AWESs and the one of traditional wind turbines, using MERRA-2 wind data from different locations. The power generation profiles of the two wind technologies are compared and found to be similar, especially at places with a low wind shear.* </P>  <P>So far, work has focused on assessing wind data for AWES operation, computing the power generation and assessing the economic potential of isolated AWESs. However, the role that AWE could play as a part of the electricity system has not been analysed in detail yet. Apart from the individual power production level of AWES units, their interaction with other power production technologies in the electricity system is of great importance. A generation profile that correlates with the net load of the electricity system has a high economical value. Here, the net load is defined by the system load minus renewable generation.

RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on the economic potential of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) and their impact on the electricity system. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for AWESs is estimated to be between 33 and 150 M=Wh, indicating a high degree of cost uncertainty. The study also emphasizes the importance of the electricity generation profile, defined as the distribution of electricity production over time. A generation profile that aligns with the net load of the electricity system is economically valuable. The study aims to assess the economic value of electricity generation from AWESs in four different regional electricity systems. It specifically focuses on drag-mode AWESs, which generate electric power using on-board propellers and transfer it to the ground via a tether. The annual generation profiles of two differently sized AWESs are modeled within four characteristic regions, with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25. This equates to an area of approximately 430 km2 in Southern Sweden. Unlike traditional wind turbines (WT), which are modeled using a power curve for a 2 MW generator, AWES power generation is calculated through an optimal control problem (OCP). This takes into account physical limitations such as tether drag and calculates maximum power production and optimal flight trajectory based on prevailing wind speeds. The computed electricity generation profiles are implemented in a regional cost-minimizing electricity system model, formulated as a linear optimization problem. The model explores the interaction between different generation, load, and storage technologies, assuming no prior installed capacity. Instead of modeling AWE technology related to an estimated cost, a certain installed AWE capacity is enforced in the electricity system model. The research concludes that AWES's economic value to the electricity system can be quantified in terms of the marginal system value (MSV). The study references earlier work on AWES operation13, power curve estimation5,9,14,15, optimal power generation profile16, and optimal control problem18,19. This study contributes to the understanding of the economic potential of AWESs and their role within the electricity system. It also provides a modeling approach for assessing the economic value of AWESs in different regional electricity systems.
