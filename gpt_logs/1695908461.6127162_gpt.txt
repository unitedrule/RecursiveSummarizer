The MSV denotes the change in electricity system cost with respect to an incremental change to the predefined fixed installed AWE capacity. Practically, the MSV is obtained by increasing the fixed AWE capacity step-wise between model runs, which results in less installed capacity by other technologies and thus changes in the investment and variable costs of the electricity system.

RESPONSE:

The study explores the Marginal System Value (MSV) of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) using an electricity system model. This model is an optimization problem aimed at determining the mix of electricity generation technologies that can fulfill electricity demand at the lowest cost. The model's decision variables include investments in electricity generation capacity and the three-hourly generation, with investment and running costs of different electricity technologies being key parameters. As the costs of AWESs are highly uncertain, the model does not provide their investment cost. Instead, it uses a fixed available capacity for AWESs to supply a certain percentage of annual electricity demand. The MSV, which denotes changes in electricity system cost with respect to an incremental change in fixed installed AWES capacity, is computed for various AWES shares. To obtain the MSV for a specific AWES share, denoted as ?, the annual marginal system value c0(?) is derived first. This is mathematically described as ?ctot??? ctot?? ?0:05? ctot?? 0:05? and c0??? ? 0,0:1,,1,. The share ? ranges from 0 to 1 in discrete steps of 0.1. Enforcing larger AWES shares as ? 0:6 1 entails AWE curtailment due to excessive supply at some hours of the year. The study assumes that AWE is a free power source. Thus, an increase in share ? leads to a higher AWES capacity s (?) and lower total system costs ctot??). The change in costs ?c can be related to the value of AWE in the system. From another perspective, ?ctot??? represents the willingness to pay for extra AWES capacity installed at a certain share ?. The annual marginal system costs are divided by annuity factor AF to obtain the marginal system value MSV(?), expressed as MSV???c0??? with AF r 11 , ?10? and AF ?1 ?r?t. Here, r 0:05 is the interest rate, and the expected AWE lifetime is t 30. The value of MSV(?) corresponds to the upper bound of the combined investment and fixed O&M costs of a cost-competitive AWES. The study is performed for four characteristic regions: Ireland (IE), a windy region; south-central Sweden (SE2), a windy and hydro-dominated region; central Spain (ES3), a low wind but sunny region; and Hungary (HU), a region with medium wind and solar.
