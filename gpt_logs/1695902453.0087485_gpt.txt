CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This research paper discusses the potential of airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) in the context of a conceptual future electricity system. The study examines two key variables: AWES farm density and the role of storage technologies. The AWES farm density is varied by introducing a location-independent density factor, with two values, 10% and 100%, being explored. Although a complete space availability is unlikely, higher farm density could be achieved through sophisticated system control. However, an explicit density case could not be extracted from the modeling. The study does not incorporate storage technologies like batteries, fuel cells, or fly wheels into the electricity system model. Despite their significance in future electricity systems, the omission of these elements may not significantly impact the relation between AWESs and Wind Turbines (WTs). Demand Side Management (DSM) is also excluded from the modeled scenarios. The research models an isolated electricity system without any trading provisions. This dismissal of variable power generation and demand smoothing options represents an unrealistic scenario but helps maintain clarity on regional system dynamics and interactions between different electricity generation technologies. Results reveal considerable differences between small AWES (sAWES) of 666 kW and large AWES (LAWES). The sAWES offers a power profile of higher value and more Full Load Hours (FLHs) than LAWES due to its lower weight per wing area and lower tether drag. However, considering the required land area, it is uncertain if the system with lower power density per system would be preferred for large-scale deployment. In most modeled scenarios, AWESs are optimally allocated in the lowest wind-speed classes where WTs are initially installed. Factors like farm power density, FLHs, and acceptance should be maximized for efficient planning and funding allocation. Offshore locations are not considered in this study but could potentially enhance AWE value and increase total wind power share in the electricity mix. The study derives AWE power profiles by optimizing a drag-mode system, leaving the exploration of pumping-mode systems for future investigations. Lloyd's previous study suggests that both systems could generate similar total power, although instantaneous power generation might vary. This comparison is beyond the scope of this paper. The research concludes with an emphasis on the economic value of AWESs in a conceptual future electricity system.
