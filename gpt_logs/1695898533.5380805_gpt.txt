CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This research article snippet discusses the potential of airborne wind energy (AWE) and the need for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization (RDD&C) activities to validate its technical and economic viability. The authors highlight the support for AWE research in the European Union (EU) and the intermittent support in the United States (US). They propose a conceptual RDD&C plan that spans a 10-year period and includes various elements and activities. These include characterizing the wind resource above traditional turbines, conducting cost and feasibility studies, deepening the understanding of AWE concepts through modeling and simulation, establishing test facilities, encouraging industry R&D, participating in standards-setting organizations, assessing social acceptance and environmental implications, attracting talent, and exploring cost-effective policies and technical assistance mechanisms. The priority and timing of these activities would depend on the desired commercial timeline, funding availability, and targeted AWE market. The article also includes a table of contents and legislative language references.
