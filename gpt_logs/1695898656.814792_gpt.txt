CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a study on airborne wind energy (AWE) technologies, which convert wind energy into electricity using tethered flying devices. The study included a synthesis of existing literature, internal analysis, and interviews with AWE industry leaders. WETO supported a technical workshop on U.S. Airborne Wind Energy in March 2021, attended by over 100 experts. The assessment concluded that the technical resource potential of AWE systems is uncertain but likely similar to traditional wind energy systems. AWE has the potential to provide a significant source of energy if captured economically, but it remains an immature and unproven technology requiring further development. AWE technologies are fundamentally different from traditional wind turbines, presenting challenges and opportunities in design, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, installation, operations, and maintenance. There is currently no preferred technology or approach for AWE systems, and no commercially deployed megawatt-scale systems exist. AWE systems must sustain flight in demanding atmospheric conditions while operating autonomously and being tethered to the ground.
