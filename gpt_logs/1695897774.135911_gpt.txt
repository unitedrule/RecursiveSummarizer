CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The document under review is a report from the United States Department of Energy titled "Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Energy in the United States," dated November 2021. The report was developed to be presented to Congress, and it provides an in-depth analysis of the potential for and technical viability of airborne wind energy as a significant energy source within the United States. The report is structured into seven main sections: Legislative Language, Purpose and Method, Airborne Wind Energy Technology, Review of State of the Art, U.S. Challenges and Opportunities, Conclusion, and References. The report also includes an appendix detailing the closure of Makani, a project related to airborne wind energy. The report presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in airborne wind energy, including insights from a 2018 European Union-Commissioned Report, a 2020 Airborne Wind Energy Topical Expert Meeting, and a 2021 U.S. Airborne Wind Energy Workshop. The section on U.S. Challenges and Opportunities further breaks down into three subsections: Potential and Viability, Research, Development & Demonstration, and Commercialization. These sections provide an analysis of current challenges facing airborne wind energy technology in the U.S., as well as potential opportunities for its development and commercialization. The report was prepared in response to directives set forth in the Energy Act of 2020. It outlines a series of research, development, demonstration, and commercialization activities necessary to advance, test, and potentially validate the viability of airborne wind energy systems. This report was delivered to several members of Congress including The Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson (Chairwoman, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology), The Honorable Frank Lucas (Ranking Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology), The Honorable Joe Manchin III (Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources), and The Honorable John.
