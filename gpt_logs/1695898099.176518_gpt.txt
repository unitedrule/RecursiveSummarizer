CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research begins by acknowledging the contribution of Ockels' research in proposing a pumping mill design and considering concepts that fly lower in the atmosphere. This has led to the formation of two spinoff companies and a global network of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) researchers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs, now comprising more than 60 organizations. The U.S. AWE community is smaller than Europe's as shown in Figure 4. From 2009 to 2012, the AWE community convened for annual international conferences, alternating between the United States and Europe. Starting in 2013, these conferences were held biennially across various European locations. The 2019 conference saw participation from over 220 delegates from 21 countries. In terms of commercial status and funding, the global AWE market is heavily skewed towards Europe due to stronger public sector support. Most proposed Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) are at or below a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, with TRL 6 indicating a large prototype capable of performing all operational system functions. As of publication, only SkySails has shipped a commercial product globally, but all companies are expected to do so within the next 15 years. The entry market for most companies is distributed, remote, or microgrid applications with plans to scale up to larger products by 2030. In Europe, AWE grants amounting to approximately $58M have been awarded by the EU and national/regional organizations since 2008. To achieve commercialization by 2025, the technology will require continued Research, Development & Deployment (RD&D) assistance and significant market support. In contrast, U.S Federal entities have supported AWE technology development with approximately $13M direct investment since 2009 through one ARPA-E OPEN award and multiple Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards from Department of Defense (DOD), U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA), and National Science Foundation (NSF). Additionally, $11.9M has been invested in kite-like devices for underwater energy harvesting. Between 2010 and 2020, European funding for AWE was roughly four times higher than in the United States. Besides public funds, some developers have managed to raise over $200M in capital from external investors as of 2019 according to Bloomberg. The research also summarizes three efforts at assessing the state of the AWE market: an EU-commissioned report on commercializing AWE in Europe, an expert meeting aimed at formalizing international collaboration on AWE, and a U.S.-centric airborne wind workshop held in support of the present report. These resources address various aspects of the Congressional request and are consistent in their conclusions and recommendations.
