CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article by Kennel RM, Hackl CM, Campagnolo F, Patt M, Schmehl R titled "Drag power kite with very high lift coefficient" published in Renew Energy in 2017 discusses the development and optimization of a drag power kite with high lift coefficient for renewable energy generation[1]. The research conducted by Malz EC, Koenemann J, Sieberling S, Gros S published in 2019 provides a reference model for airborne wind energy systems for optimization and control[33]. In 2012, Harham C responded to the Federal Aviation Authority regarding Makani Power's airborne wind energy systems[34]. Makani Power's work is available for reference online[35]. In 2020, Roque LAC, Paivab LT, Fernandesb MCRM, Fontesc DBMM, Fontesb FACC worked on the layout optimization of an airborne wind energy farm for maximum power generation[36]. In his Ph.D. dissertation, Fagiano L discussed the control of tethered airfoils for high-altitude wind energy generation and emphasized on advanced control methods as key technologies for a breakthrough in renewable energy generation[37]. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) developed by GAMS Development Corporation in 2019 is a significant tool used in the research[38]. Gansson L, Goop J, Odenberger M, Johnsson F's research on the impact of thermal plant cycling on the cost-optimal composition of a regional electricity generation system published in Appl Energy in 2017 was referenced[39]. Nilsson K and Unger T also discussed the bending of a European wind power potential with GIS analysis in 2014[40]. The European Commission's NATURA 2000 provided valuable data for the research[41]. Norwood Z, Nyholm E, Otanicar T, Johnsson F conducted a geospatial comparison of distributed solar heat and power in Europe and the US in 2014[42]. The NASA's modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications (Merra) was used in the research[43]. Finally, the research also referenced Energi S, Verksamheten E 2015's work on energy companies available online[44].
