RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the value of airborne wind energy (AWE) to the electricity system, with a specific focus on marginal system value (MSV), wind speed ranges, and land area for each region and wind class. The study provides a detailed analysis of four regions: SE2, IE, ES3, HU, and their respective wind classes. For each region and wind class, the land area (km²) and wind speed range (m/s) are provided. The average wind speed (Aw) and total area (A) for each region are also presented. The study explores the system value of adding 1 MW AWE at different initial AWE shares (?) of the total produced annual electricity. It shows that at lower AWE shares, the MSV is almost flat for windy areas of SE2 (for ? < 0.6) and IE (for ? < 0.3). This happens if AWESs repeatedly replace the WTs of one specific wind class within a 0.1-interval of ?, implying that the total wind power generation in the system remains more or less constant. With each ?-step, the additional energy from AWE reduces the need for the same amount of WT capacity (?s), accompanied by an equal change in cost (?ctot), resulting in a constant MSV. At higher AWE shares, however, the system saturates and the MSV declines more drastically. In other words, the technology outcompetes itself when the capacity of AWE is increased beyond a certain point. The study also shows that increased AWE share results in increased wind energy curtailment. The article includes several figures that illustrate these findings visually, such as marginal system value (MSV) corresponding to different initial AWE shares, thermal power generation as a function of AWE share relative to zero-AWE case, and projected capital and O&M cost of the reference wind turbine. The study concludes by stating that the competition between wind technologies will be discussed in more detail in the future.
