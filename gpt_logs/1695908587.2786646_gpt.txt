RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the variability of wind resources across different regions and classes, indicating that wind speeds in class five in low-wind regions equal the wind speeds in low classes for high-wind areas. The article presents the MSV (Marginal System Value) for four regions and four AWES (Airborne Wind Energy Systems) cases. The horizontal grey dashed line represents a reference MSV of 1541 k= MW, which is equivalent to the cost of a representative 2MW wind turbine, including capital cost and projected O&M cost for an average full load hours (FLH) over 30 years of operation. The study shows that the MSV of AWE can reach up to MSV?? 0?2:2M= MW(SE2), meaning that AWES may cost 150% of the wind turbine (WT) and still be valuable to the electricity system. The MSV of AWES varies between regions, ranging from 1.3 to 2.2 = MW at low electricity share levels and from 0.4 to 1 M= MW at high shares. By estimating the LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Electricity) for individual MSV levels, a range of 3545 = MWh is obtained for low share levels, which can be compared to the estimated range of 33 = MWh and 150 = MWh in previous studies. The level of MSV is determined by four factors: the AWE share of power generation; power density (MW= km) of AWESs; AWE FLHs; and temporal distribution of AWE power generation. With an increasing share of AWE capacity in the electricity system, there is a general declining trend in MSV across all regions due to gradual replacement of WTs by AWESs, increased need for thermal peak generation to manage generation-load balance, and/or saturation of electricity system with wind power, leading to increased wind energy curtailment. The article also provides a detailed table showing the land area and wind speed range for each region and wind class, as well as the wind speed average and total area for each region. The figures illustrate the MSV, corresponding to the system value of adding 1 MW AWE at different initial AWE shares of the total produced annual electricity. The green lines represent the large AWE system (LAWES) for the low density factor (10%) and high density factor (100%).
