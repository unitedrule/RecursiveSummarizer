CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the challenges and opportunities for airborne wind energy. Traditional wind technology faces challenges in terms of transportation logistics due to larger rotors and taller towers. Airborne wind technology replaces the support structure with a lightweight tether, reducing mass by around 90 percent. This allows airborne wind to harvest wind at higher altitudes, which can be stronger and more consistent. The tether also allows for adjusting the flight path and mitigating airspace conflicts. Airborne wind can be deployed quickly and lowered to the ground for maintenance, potentially opening new markets and improving technician safety. The lower mass inputs, easier logistics, and potentially higher capacity factor may lead to a reduced cost of energy compared to traditional wind technology in certain regions or markets. The International Renewable Energy Agency recognized airborne wind energy as a potential game changer in their innovation report for offshore wind in 2016.
