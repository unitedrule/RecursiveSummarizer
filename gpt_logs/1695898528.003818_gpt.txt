RESPONSE:

The U.S. Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), conducted a study on the potential and technical viability of airborne wind energy (AWE) technologies. This study involved a synthesis of existing literature, internal analysis by NREL, and interviews with industry leaders in the AWE field. WETO also organized a technical workshop attended by over 100 experts and stakeholders. Based on their activities, WETO concluded that the technical resource potential of wind energy available to AWE systems is uncertain but likely comparable to that of traditional wind energy systems. The extent to which AWE represents an additional resource depends on the energy harvesting characteristics of commercial designs. Even without additionality, the combined resource of AWE and traditional wind energy remains significant for national electricity use. While AWE has the potential to be a significant energy source if captured economically, it is still an immature and unproven technology that requires further development before it can be deployed at meaningful scales nationally. AWE technologies differ from traditional wind turbines in various aspects, including design, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, installation, operations, and maintenance. These differences present both challenges and opportunities that go beyond the scope of traditional wind energy research and development. AWE system designs are diverse and largely experimental at this stage, with no commercially deployed megawatt-scale systems. However, several designs under development show promise, and there is still more exploration needed in the overall design space. AWE systems are technically complex, similar to high-performance aircraft, and must sustain flight under demanding atmospheric conditions. Additionally, they must operate autonomously while being tethered to the ground, which poses additional challenges. Overall, while AWE holds potential as a significant energy source, further research and development are necessary to overcome technical challenges and achieve economic viability at a national level.
