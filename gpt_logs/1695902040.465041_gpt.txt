CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the implementation of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) in an electricity system model, focusing on the constraints and parameters that need to be considered. This includes the total land surface area available for wind power installations, which must be shared between AWESs and conventional wind turbines. The available area is reduced by factors such as inland waters, cities, natural reserves, and other reserved land uses. The study presents a mathematical formulation for sharing the total land surface area between AWESs and wind turbines, where k is the wind class, P is the power density of AWE and WT respectively, and Ak is the available land surface area in class k. Another constraint discussed in the article is related to the calculation of the marginal system value (MSV). The total AWE power production should supply a certain share of the total regional electricity demand. This constraint is formulated mathematically with Dt representing regional electricity demand at time t; sAWEfkg representing AWES installed capacity; and GAWEfkg,t being the regional generation profile of AWES in class k. Apart from wind technologies, photovoltaic and hydro systems are also part of renewable power generation options included in the model. Thermal generation fueled by biogas or a combination of biogas and natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS), as well as nuclear power generation, are also considered. For photovoltaic resource modeling, an optimal-tilt device is used based on Norwood et al's formulation and solar radiation data from MERRA in 2012. Hydro power data is based on inflow profile data from 2012, with average inflow representing a typical hydrological year taken from Svensk Energi. Costs of thermal technologies and fuels are derived from IEA World Energy Outlook 2016-2018 and Thunman et al., with costs of other technologies found in a previous study. The article also mentions that the model has been used in several studies focusing on electric vehicles and traditional wind power. All the technologies involved in the study are listed in Table 1, with the relevant data for this study listed in Table B2. The remaining constraints and data related to technologies, resources, and emissions are provided in Appendix B1. The methods and data used in the study were derived from previous studies.
