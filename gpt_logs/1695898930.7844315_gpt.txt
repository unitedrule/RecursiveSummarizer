speed profile becomes mostly flat up to 500m [7]. Any discussion of reaching additional wind resource at significant heights must consider the effects of increased tether length and elevation angle, which tend to reduce these gains [6]. In the windiest locations, the higher altitude achieved by AWE is less important, therefore the value of AWE may come from areas with low wind, high shear, or high terrain complexity.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Malz [44] performed one of the first complementarity studies <Link>3</Link>  for continental Europe and found that AWE is most valuable to the electricity system if installed at sites with low wind speed within a region. At greater shares of the electricity system, even if AWES could demonstrate lower costs compared to wind turbines, AWE would merely substitute for them instead of increasing the total share of wind energy in the system.  The study used only one AWE design concept (fly-gen) and focused specifically on onshore deployments in Europe, so additional AWE concepts and the U.S. context (including offshore) could be studied for a more complete perspective on this question.  </P>  <Footnote> <P xml:lang="EN-US">3 Research to describe the degree to which airborne wind energy can generate electricity cost effectively where or when traditional wind energy cannot. </P> </Footnote>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">In a different view of complementarity, the supply chains for traditional and airborne wind energy will be largely independent; as such, the development of AWE technology could help mitigate potential supply chain constraints in a scenario with rapid clean energy deployment. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Viability for Distributed, Remote, and Disaster Applications </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Many developers (in the United States and globally) are focused on relatively small AWES, rated at 1100 kilowatts (kW), for distributed, micro-grid, off-grid, or military customers. This is due to (1) the global nature of the potential market, (2) the higher value of energy in that market, (3) the need for low-cost design prototypes, many of which are destroyed during testing, and (4) the cost and technology risk perceived by utility scale players that could favor larger designs. The value of energy for military forward operating bases, for example, is high because soldiers may be put in harms way to deliver the fuel for diesel generators [45]. Remote communities or islands may not have reliable grid connections or may be reliant on imported diesel fuel. In those cases, AWE can complement solar PV or other distributed energy resources in microgrid applications. Assuming such communities have the capacity to manage the deployment and maintenance of advanced technologies like AWE, these applications can provide critical energy to communities and individuals that need it but may not have a large impact at grid scale. One challenge for single-unit installations is that energy storage above and beyond a typical microgrid may be needed to smooth out power fluctuations.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Viability for Land-Based Applications </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The potential of AWE as a stand-alone utility resource on land is sensitive to a variety of performance metrics, such as capacity factor, specific power e.g. kite MW/m2, and power capacity density e.g., installed MW/km2. It is also sensitive to tether lengths and required safety setbacks from the wind farm to civil infrastructure, which may vary depending on system architecture, scale, regulation, and available on-board safety systems [7]. Because of these sensitivities and the lack of any commercial platform on which to baseline analysis, the technical potential of AWE (which accounts for social, environmental, and regulatory spatial considerations and technology performance) is highly uncertain. Based on NRELs analysis of characteristics that may lead to a cost-competitive AWE system in 2030 [7], a successful land-based AWE product would have traits specific to the areas in which it is deployed. If land for development is scarce, the focus would be on achieving high-capacity densities above 10 MW/km2. If land is plentiful, AWE could target high-capacity factors and lower capital expenditures to be competitive. This approach is not unique to AWE; traditional wind similarly tailors products for specific markets, such as larger rotors or taller towers in areas with lower wind speeds [46]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Viability for Hybrid Power Plants or Repowering </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Electricity-producing facilities can potentially benefit from co-locating airborne wind within the footprint of existing or new development. Wake losses of AWE technology are believed to be low [47], so they could potentially be deployed within the footprint of existing wind farms to increase capacity factor. In older wind farms with smaller turbines, AWES could potentially fly entirely above the existing structures or be part of a repowering solution for older turbines at the end of their design life. Similarly, the shadow of a kite at relatively high altitude is believed to be minimal and the foundation infrastructure much smaller than traditional wind, so AWE could also be deployed within utility-scale solar plants to complement the diurnal nature of their resource. It is important to note that these applications are hypothetical, have not been demonstrated, and may introduce new challenges (e.g., difficult flying in the wake of a traditional wind turbine, property risks from overflying a solar installation, and the dense spacing of older wind farms), but they could perhaps help plant owners and grid operators make the most of existing infrastructure. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Viability for Offshore Applications </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The theoretical AWE attributes of low wake losses, smaller and cheaper support structures, and the ability to install and maintain them without needing expensive large service vessels make a compelling case for further technology research and development in offshore applications. Approximately 58 percent of the U.S. offshore wind resource is in water deeper than 60m and will require floating platforms to access using conventional wind turbines [48]. The floating platform is the largest CapEx component of LCOE for floating wind [49]; therefore, AWE may have an advantage in deeper waters if they are able to operate from significantly smaller platforms or with lower mooring requirements. However, these beneficial attributes have yet to be demonstratedonshore or offshore. The smaller scale (in MW per unit) predicted for initial offshore AWE installations may force more units to be installed in an area to generate the same rated capacity. This could cause greater conflict with other ocean users and stakeholders. In the United States, where offshore projects are planned with relatively constant spacing between turbines (~1 nautical mile grid) [50] to allow for navigation and co-use, it may be challenging for AWE to achieve the same capacity densities as traditional wind [7]. The contribution of AWE in the offshore space will be sensitive to the scaling potential of AWE concepts to higher capacity per platform, through unit scale or multiple kites, and to the ability of the industry to demonstrate reliability over thousands of launch/generate/land sequences. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Activities to Further Quantify Potential and Viability </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Initial techno-economic analysis for the U.S. market [7] has focused on onshore deployment and found that the results are sensitive to a variety of uncertain inputs including setbacks, tether length, system performance, operational expenses, and achievable AWE array capacity density. The uncertainty can be traced partly to the fact that there are no megawatt-scale products or commercial deployments on which to base the analysis, and partly to the wide range of AWE designs, performance, operational strategies, and cost projections found in literature and shared at the recent U.S. airborne wind workshop. As more data become available and tools for modeling system cost and performance evolve, this analysis could be extended and periodically revisited with an eye toward national and regional cost and feasibility studies to evaluate key cost drivers, market potential (including offshore), and operational strategies of AWES. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Wind energy developers and researchers have spent considerable sums to characterize the planetary boundary layer up to the tip heights of existing wind turbines (~200m), and there is still great uncertainty in the dynamics of the shears, veers, and turbulence at those elevations. AWES may fly much higher (primarily 200800m) and quality field data in that range are even more scarce. Developers and policymakers need accurate wind resource data to make design and investment decisions, suggesting a need for multiple long-term measurement campaigns, including at least one located offshore, and refinement of mesoscale modeling techniques to better enable extrapolation to other locations. Existing wind resource datasets that end at 200m could be updated with results extracted as high as 1km to inform techno-economic modeling, support preliminary siting, and encourage developer interest. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">To track the development of the technology and further refine our estimates of the available resource and technical potential, several activities are highlighted in  <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Table 2</Reference> .
