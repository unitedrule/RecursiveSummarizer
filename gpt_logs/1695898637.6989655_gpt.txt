For airborne wind, a nascent, unproven technology, to achieve significant commercial success by 2035 would require a rapid expansion of R&amp;D activities and an acceleration of commercialization that is unprecedented in energy production technology. For a sense of scale, Federal support of wind energy research dates back over four decades, the wind production tax credit almost three decades, and it has taken nearly that long for wind to become commercially competitive across much of the country. AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, but the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines (for AWE and other clean technologies) and the evolution of the U.S. power sector size and requirements means that projection is much more difficult to make with confidence.</rdf:li>             </rdf:Alt>          </dc:description>          <pdf:Producer>Adobe PDF Library 21.7.131</pdf:Producer>          <pdfx:SourceModified>D:20211109191149</pdfx:SourceModified>          <pdfx:Company>U.S. Department of Energy</pdfx:Company>          <pdfx:ContentTypeId>0x010100055405B08DD34D4DB118DDB88C246E4B</pdfx:ContentTypeId>          <pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>46b98e98-c3e6-4322-8bfa-12cf298a26a4</pdfx:_dlc_DocIdItemGuid>       </rdf:Description>    </rdf:RDF> </x:xmpmeta>


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The given text is an XML representation of a research article titled "Report to Congress: Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Energy in the United States" by the U.S. Department of Energy, Wind Energy Technologies Office. The report aims to address the question posed by Congress regarding the viability of airborne wind as a significant source of energy in the United States. It highlights that achieving significant commercial success for airborne wind by 2035 would require rapid expansion of research and development (R&D) activities and unprecedented acceleration of commercialization. The report also mentions that while it is possible for airborne wind to become a significant energy source by 2050, uncertainties in estimating technology cost declines and the evolution of the U.S. power sector make projections more challenging. The report emphasizes the need for continued support and investment in airborne wind research and development to unlock its full potential.
