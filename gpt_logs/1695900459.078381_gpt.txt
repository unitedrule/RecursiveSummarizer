RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on the value of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) in future emission-free electricity systems, with a projected outlook towards 2050. The key metric used to assess this is the Marginal System Value (MSV), defined as the change in annual total electricity system cost divided by the change in installed capacity of AWESs. This allows for an estimation of AWES technology's maximum cost for economical viability. The study builds on previous work by Gansson and Malz et al, which respectively investigated MSVs for various wind turbine designs and compared AWESs and Wind Turbines (WTs) in terms of generation profiles. The methodology involves the use of high-resolution wind data from ERA-5 provided by ECMWF for all analyzed regions, collected for the full year of 2012. The AWES model requires wind data at multiple altitudes to generate a vertical wind profile. The wind speeds are further processed into a family of smooth polynomial functions of the altitude, which is necessary to estimate the wind speeds for the WT at a height of 100m and to provide a vertical wind profile function to the AWES model. For an accurate potential assessment of the two different wind power technologies, their power generation is computed with a WT model and an AWES model. In a large wind farm, instantaneous wind speeds are assumed to be normally distributed over the farm with a standard deviation of 1m/s. The influence on the wind farm power output is further illustrated in a figure. The article structure includes: Section 2 detailing wind data, models, and optimization techniques; Section 3 presenting results; Section 4 discussing findings; and Section 5 concluding the study.
