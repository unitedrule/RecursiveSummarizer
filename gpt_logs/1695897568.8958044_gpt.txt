As part of its inquiry, WETO drew on findings and insights gained from a synthesis of existing literature, NREL internal analysis, and outreach through interviews of AWE industry leaders.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted an assessment of airborne wind energy (AWE) technologies as a potential source of energy in the United States. The assessment drew on existing literature, internal analysis, and interviews with industry leaders. The report highlights the uncertain but significant potential of AWE systems to provide energy, as well as the need for further development before widespread deployment. AWE technologies differ from traditional wind turbines and present unique challenges and opportunities. Various AWE designs are under development, but no commercial-scale systems have been deployed yet. The report also discusses the intermittent federal support for AWE research compared to the European Union's more active support. To advance AWE technology, the authors propose a 10-year research, development, demonstration, and commercialization plan that includes characterizing the wind resource, conducting cost and feasibility studies, deepening understanding through modeling and simulation, establishing test facilities, encouraging industry R&D, participating in standards-setting organizations, assessing social acceptance and environmental implications, and attracting talent to the AWE industry.
