CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article titled "The value of airborne wind energy to the electricity system" by Malz EC, Walter V, Gansson L, Gros S, published in Wind Energy in 2022 (Volume 25, Issue 2), investigates the potential of airborne wind energy (AWE) within the electricity system. The article includes an appendix with a detailed breakdown of turbine function and parameters. The cp-value (power coefficient) is defined through a mathematical formula that incorporates the maximum and minimum break point wind speeds and the slope of the cp curve. The rated wind speed is also mathematically defined using parameters such as capacity and maximum cp value. Table A1 provides values for parameters like external losses (0.94), internal losses (0.885), rotor diameter (100m), cut-in wind speed (3 m/s), WT generator size (1.94 MW), and cut-out wind speed (25 m/s). These values are drawn from a prior study. The article also provides a mathematical model for the electricity system, formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem with the objective of minimizing total annual system costs. It includes sets, parameters, and variables relevant to this study as listed in Table B1 and technology data in Table B2. The LP problem is outlined in Section 2.3 including constraints related to hydro power, thermal generation, and emissions. Current storage of hydro power is constrained by water reservoir capacity, maximum power plant capacity, and weather-dependent inflow. Thermal power production technologies are limited by their cycling abilities - start-up and minimal load abilities - which also define their 'hot' capacity. The sets and variables of the LP problem are then detailed in Table B1. The paper can be cited as: Malz EC, Walter V, Gansson L, Gros S. The value of airborne wind energy to the electricity system.
