CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This research article investigates the value of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) to the electricity system. Two cases of AWES were assessed: a large wing with a 2 MW capacity and a small wing with 0.6 MW capacity, with both high and low power density factors per land area considered for each. The electricity generation profiles of the AWESs were obtained by optimizing the flight trajectory of the AWES, taking into account hourly wind conditions at various altitudes. The value of AWE systems was investigated for four regions, which differ in renewable electricity generation conditions and seasonal electricity demand distribution. The results indicated that the marginal system value (MSV) of AWESs varies for low electricity shares between 1.3 and 2.2 M=MW, while at high shares, the MSV lies between 0.4 and 1 M=MW. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) range is 3545 MWh, which corresponds to the lower bound of the AWE costs estimated by previous work. The study also found that the total share of wind energy in the electricity system is not increased by introducing AWESs because their power profiles are very similar to those of traditional wind turbines (WTs), leading to a simple replacement dependent on system cost and potential system saturation. In regions with good wind conditions, AWESs have higher value when replacing traditional WTs on poor wind sites, leaving high-wind sites for traditional WTs due to their higher number of full load hours (FLHs) but less even generation profile compared to WTs. For less windy regions like HU and ES3 where there's limited wind resource, wind power is mainly installed in highest wind class. For higher system value, factors like high system power density, high number of FLHs relative to WTs, and low variability in generation profile during the year should be pursued. These factors positively affect the MSV of AWESs and contribute to the technology's commercialization. The authors suggest future work to investigate the interplay of AWE and the electricity system for other AWES technologies like pumping-mode system or multi-kite AWES and to extend the work by including offshore areas. Additionally, a more thorough analysis should consider heating and transport sector as well as storage technologies in the electricity system model.
