RESPONSE:

The research article discusses a model for renewable power generation, which includes wind technologies, photovoltaic systems, hydro systems, and thermal generation fuelled by biogas or biogas combined with natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power. The model utilizes the regional generation profile of the Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems. For photovoltaics, an optimal-tilt device is modelled using Norwood et al's formulation and solar radiation data from MERRA in 2012. Hydro power is only present in the SE2 region with water inflow profile data from 2012 and average inflow representing a typical hydrological year taken from Svensk Energi. The costs of thermal technologies and fuels are taken from the IEA World Energy Outlook 2016201845 and Thunman et al., with fuel costs and other technology costs found in a previous study. The model also involves constraints and data related to technologies, resources, and emissions as given in Appendix B1. The methods and data are taken from previous studies, and the model has been used for several studies focusing on electric vehicles or traditional wind power. The article further discusses the Marginal System Value (MSV) of AWEs. The electricity system model is an optimization problem designed to investigate the combination of electricity generation technologies to meet the electricity demand at the lowest cost. The decision variables include investments in electricity generation capacity as well as three-hourly generation. Investment and running costs of different electricity generation technologies are key parameters. However, since the costs of AWEs are uncertain, their investment cost is not available. To investigate the MSV of AWESs, the model fixes their available capacity such that they supply a certain percentage of annual electricity demand. The installed capacities of other technologies are decision variables. The MSV represents changes in electricity system cost with respect to an incremental change to the predefined fixed installed AWE capacity. The MSV is obtained by increasing the fixed AWE capacity step-wise between model runs, leading to changes in the investment and variable costs of the electricity system. As found in previous work, the MSV varies greatly with the share of electricity supplied by the analyzed technology; hence, the MSV is computed for different AWE shares.
