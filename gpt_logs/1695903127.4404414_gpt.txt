altitude is not constant, but varies for optimal power output. Thus, the AWES power is a function of the entire vertical wind profile and the optimal flight trajectory is dependent on the prevailing wind conditions. There exist different approaches of estimating the power production of an AWES, using static, quasi-steady or dynamic models of the AWES.2732 In this study, the model is formulated in the form of a dynamical system, and both the flight trajectory and the average power of the AWES are maximized for each wind profile. The system describes the AWE wing operating on a circular trajectory. The wing is modelled as a rigid body that is influenced by the prevailing wind speeds, the corresponding aerodynamic forces and control inputs. The method and the entire dynamical system is described in detail in previous studies.18,33 As the power generation depends on the wind speeds at the current flight altitude, the dynamical system is implemented in an optimal control problem (OCP) that maximizes the average power generation of one flight orbit for a certain wind profile. This OCP is formulated as </P>  <P>min ??x,z,u,p,T??3a? </P>  <P>x;z;u </P>  <P>s:t: F?x_,x,z,u,p,T?0, ?3b? </P>  <P>x?0?,x?T?0, ?3c? </P>  <P>h?x,z,u,p,T?? 0, ?3d? </P>  <P>where the decision variables are the system states x &#8; ?22, the algebraic state z &#8; ?1, and the control inputs u &#8; ?4.

RESPONSE:

The research article explores the power production of an Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES) which is influenced by the entire vertical wind profile and the optimal flight trajectory. The power output is not constant as it varies for optimal results. Different methods for estimating AWES power are mentioned, such as using static, quasi-steady, or dynamic models. In this study, the AWES model is formulated as a dynamical system where both the flight trajectory and the average power are maximized for each wind profile. This system describes the AWES wing operating on a circular trajectory, which is influenced by prevailing wind speeds, aerodynamic forces, and control inputs. The dynamical system was implemented in an Optimal Control Problem (OCP) that maximizes average power generation for one flight orbit per wind profile. The OCP is expressed as: min ??x,z,u,p,T??3a?, x;z;u, s:t: F?x_,x,z,u,p,T?0, ?3b?, x?0?,x?T?0, ?3c?, h?x,z,u,p,T?? 0, ?3d?. The decision variables include system states (x) comprising position, velocity, rotation, angular velocity, surface controls and energy; algebraic state (z); and control inputs (u) such as change of surface controls and drag force of on-board propellers. The parameters (p) include wind data. The cost functional ?( ) (3a) maximizes average power generation during orbit time T and regularizes control inputs. The system function (3b) describes flight dynamics. Constraints (3c) enforce periodicity of flight trajectory while (3d) introduces physical system bounds provided by AWES physics. Two potential systems were considered since no commercial AWES is available yet. These systems are aligned to Makani wings and include a large AWES (LAWES) with 2 MW (40 m wing span) and a small AWES (sAWES) with 0.6 MW (28 m wing span). The study acknowledges the challenge of solving the highly nonlinear OCP (3) to generate an annual hourly electricity generation profile. A time-efficient numerical method for solving this large number of OCPs was proposed in a previous study, which exploits the similarity between consecutive OCP solutions resulting from different, yet similar, wind profiles. The research article references previous studies for detailed descriptions of the model, the OCP, and the numerical method for solving OCPs (18,19,25,33,34,35).
