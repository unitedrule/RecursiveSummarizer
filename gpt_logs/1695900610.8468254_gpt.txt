class for WTs is the same as that defined for that wind class for the AWESs. The wind speed interval and land surface area of the different classes can be found in Section 3 in Table 3 for each region, respectively. All generation profiles of a technology that fall within a certain wind class are averaged to one representative profile of that wind class.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research paper discusses the implementation of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) electricity generation profiles into an electricity system model. The model was originally developed in Gansson et al39 as a regional investment and dispatch model to study thermal power plant cycling and is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. The model is set up as a green-field study, assuming no prior installation of power plants, with the aim of studying the dynamics of an eventual system with net-zero CO2 emissions rather than predicting the future electricity system composition. The model's main decision variables are the regional installed capacity s of each technology and the hourly electricity generation g. The total electricity generation must meet the hourly regional load at minimal annual system cost and net-zero CO2 emissions. The model operates on a three-hourly resolution, assumes perfect foresight, and neglects distribution losses and ancillary services. Four regions - Ireland (IE), Hungary (HU), south-central Sweden (SE2), and central Spain (ES3) - are modeled in isolation, meaning import and export of electricity are not considered. The main equations of the LP problem include the problem objective that minimizes the annual system cost for investment and dispatch, as well as the constraining generation-load balance and the capacity limiting generation. The decision variable ctot represents the total annual system cost. The variable si denotes the installed capacity of technology i, and gi, t stands for the generation of technology i at time step t. I refers to the set of included technologies, and T is the set of time steps (every third hour of the year). The parameter Cinv represents the initial investment cost per technology while AFi is the annuity factor dependent on a technology's technical lifetime. The technologies included in the model results are Airborne wind energy systems of wind classes 1-5 (AWE 1,2,3,4,5), Onshore wind energy systems of wind classes 1-5 (WT 1,2,3,4,5), Hydropower with storage (Hydro), Nuclear power (Nuclear), Photovoltaic with fixed optimal tilt (crystalline silicon cells) (PV), Biogas-fueled combined cycle gas turbine (CCBGT), and Biogas-fueled open cycle gas turbine (BGT).
