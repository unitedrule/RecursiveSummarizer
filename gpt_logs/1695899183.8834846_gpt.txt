sector size and requirements means that projection is much more difficult to make with confidence.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The U.S. Department of Energy works closely with the Office of Management and Budget to provide annual budget requests to Congress for Departmental activities. For reference, in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the Wind Energy Technologies Office was allocated $104M and $110M respectively. Federal entities have supported the development of AWE technology with approximately $13M direct investment since 2009. There has also been $11.9M of investment in kite-like devices for underwater energy harvesting. However, no Federal office holds a strategic overview of these investments and how they interrelate, and there is no corresponding research program within the national lab complex that could serve as the foundation of a growing airborne wind industry. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">One can find lessons in the development of Makanis AWE technology (see [66] and [69], discussed more fully in the Appendix). With an infusion of funding from Google, Makani scaled up quickly from a 20kw to a 600kw prototype, which locked capital in tooling, embedded additional cost into every airframe and every flight test, and led the team to focus for a decade on one concept that they ultimately concluded did not have a path to commercialization. Future research can mitigate risk by initially considering multiple, low-TRL concepts, at relevant but small scales, and by insisting that well-understood performance and reliability targets be met at that TRL level before supporting larger (costlier) scale prototypes or pilots. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Prior R&amp;D can also provide insight. Wiser and Millstein [70] recently estimated that the U.S. Wind Energy R&amp;D program generated an 18-to-1 benefit-to-cost ratio from $1.7B of investment across 19762017. This implies that even if a clean energy technology has some risk of failure, the expected value of R&amp;D may be positive because of the significant long-term societal benefits of successful commercialization. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Based on insights gained from literature, NREL analysis, domestic and global outreach through the U.S. AWE workshop, numerous industry interviews, and an overall assessment, the following conclusions are drawn regarding the potential for, and technical viability of, airborne wind energy systems to provide a significant source of energy in the United States:  </P>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> The technical resource potential of wind energy available to AWE systems is uncertain, but likely similar in magnitude to that available to traditional wind energy systems. The extent to which AWE represents an additional wind energy resource is not clear, and it will depend on the energy harvesting characteristics of commercial designs. Even if there is no additionality, the resource (along with that of traditional wind energy) remains significant compared to national electricity use. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> If AWE could be captured economically, it could provide a significant source of energy. In general, however, AWE remains an immature and unproven technology that requires significant further development before it could be deployed at meaningful scales at the national level.  </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> AWE technologies are fundamentally new. They are different from traditional wind turbines in their design, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, installation, operations, and maintenance. Challenges and opportunities arise from these differences and are not within the scope of traditional wind energy research and development (R&amp;D). </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> AWE system designs to date are diverse and largely experimental. There is little convergence, so far, as to a preferred technology or approach, and no megawatt-scale AWE systems have been commercially deployed. Several AWE designs under development show promise. The overall design space has not yet been fully explored. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Like high-performance aircraft, AWES can be technically complex and must sustain flight through demanding atmospheric conditions. However, AWES also must operate autonomously and are tethered to the ground, presenting additional challenges. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Federal programs have intermittently supported U.S. AWE R&amp;D in the past (~$13M since 2009). However, AWE is actively supported by research programs in the European Union (EU) (~$58M since 2008), where most AWE advancements occur. </LBody> </LI> </L>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">With these factors in mind, the reports authors identified research, development, demonstration, and commercialization (RDD&amp;C) activities needed to advance and validate the technical and economic viability of airborne wind energy systems. These plans span a notional 10-year period and, if pursued, could occur within a phased-gate approach that communicates expectations for progress at each stage-gate, before commencing the next stage of investment. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">A conceptual RDD&amp;C plan could include the following elements and activities: </P>  <L> <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Characterize the quantity, quality, and complementary nature of the wind resource above traditional wind turbines, higher than 200 meters (m).  Carry out national and regional cost and feasibility studies to evaluate key cost drivers, market potential (including offshore), and economic benefits of AWE technology. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Broaden and deepen the physical understanding of various AWE concepts through modeling and simulation with a focus on power density, robust controls, and scaling potential. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Establish test facilities and research capacities to enable AWES developers to prove system and sub-system reliability and performance, and to study grid/micro-grid integration. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Encourage industry R&amp;D, including with cooperative research and development agreements or other mechanisms that enable access to research and engineering talent at the National Laboratories. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Participate in standards-setting organizations and contribute to the establishment of international standards for AWE design, testing, and certification. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Assess the social acceptance and environmental implications of AWE technology. Explore and, to the extent possible, quantify the environmental and human impacts of AWE. </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Attract and develop a pool of talent for the AWE industry through research fellowships, centers of excellence, prize competitions, and other training mechanisms.  </LBody> </LI>  <LI> <LBody xml:lang="EN-US"> Explore options for cost-effective policies and technical assistance mechanisms for the development and commercialization of AWE technology. </LBody> </LI> </L>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The above elements and activities are integral parts of a whole concept. All are important, but their relative priority and timing over a 10-year period would be determined by the desired commercial timeline, availability of funding from various sources, and the targeted AWE market.  </P>  <H1 id="LinkTarget_661" xml:lang="EN-US">VII.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the potential of airborne wind energy systems as a significant source of energy in the United States. It highlights the uncertainty in the technical resource potential of wind energy available to airborne wind energy (AWE) systems compared to traditional wind energy systems. The article emphasizes that AWE technology is still immature and unproven, requiring further development before it can be deployed at meaningful scales. It also points out that AWE technologies are fundamentally different from traditional wind turbines in various aspects, presenting both challenges and opportunities. The article mentions the lack of convergence on a preferred AWE technology or approach and the absence of commercially deployed megawatt-scale AWE systems. It highlights the intermittent support for AWE R&D by federal programs in the US compared to the active support in the European Union. The article proposes a conceptual research, development, demonstration, and commercialization (RDD&C) plan for AWE technology over a 10-year period, including activities such as characterizing the wind resource, deepening physical understanding, establishing test facilities, encouraging industry R&D, participating in standards-setting organizations, assessing social acceptance and environmental implications, attracting talent, and exploring cost-effective policies and technical assistance mechanisms. The relative priority and timing of these activities would depend on commercial timelines, funding availability, and target markets.
