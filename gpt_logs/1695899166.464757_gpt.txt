lower fidelity, a steady state model of AWES, along with concept-agnostic, first-order sizing, performance, and cost models (such as those proposed by Trevisi et. al. [54]), could be developed and enhanced. This would allow industry to further explore the AWE design space, evaluate new AWE concepts, and optimize power plants that utilize a mix of AWE and other generation or storage assets.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Wake losses are typically assumed to be small for AWE and early modeling tends to agree [47], but this could be confirmed with rigorous assessments that require either measurements at the farm scale, or high-fidelity simulation of at least two AWES interacting in operation. Quantifying the potential wake losses would reduce the performance risk of siting airborne systems too close, or of assuming that such a close spacing is feasible when determining the technical potential of the wind resource. Many researchers and stakeholders ( [6], [37], [55]) have expressed interest in or performed some initial scaling research, exploring how well various system architectures scale, and what might that suggest about when, where, and how they will be deployed. Appropriately, this is being studied by the new IEA Wind Task [39] and could be studied by U.S. participants. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Reference Designs and Performance Metrics </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Some generic AWE designs have been proposed (e.g., a small ground-gen model with 3m2 wing [44] and a multi-MW, 150m2 ground-gen model [56]), however more detailed concepts, reference controllers, or designs of a different architecture may become necessary for simulation tool benchmarking and collaboration among industry partners. Similarly, AWE needs a common set of metrics and language when discussing TRL and the performance of potential products. ECORYS [36] and Weber et al., [57] have proposed example language, and the IEA Wind Task [39] has proposed WP2: Reference models, tools, and metrics to support this industry need. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Grid Compliance/Integration and Control </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Airborne wind energy systems have different generation characteristics than traditional wind turbines. For example, single-kite fly-gen systems have a cyclic power output due to wind shear and gravity effects ( <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Figure 5</Reference> , left) and most ground-gen concepts consume power for a short time during whats called a pumping cycle ( <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Figure 5</Reference> , right), although designs have been proposed to avoid this [58] and it can be mitigated at low cost using wind farm controls [44].  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">It is worth studying the available types of energy storage and intelligent controls (including machine learning and artificial intelligence methods) that will add the most value by pairing them with airborne wind. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"><Figure>  <ImageData src="images/2021 - Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Ene_img_11.jpg"/> </Figure>  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Figure 5.

Although not all standards, such as IEEE 1547 and IEEE P2800, are universally mandatory as of today, it is still important to design the standard-compliant controls to streamline the future interconnection process. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">One important step in the utility interconnection process is the impact study, in which system reliability is evaluated to make sure the interconnecting generator will bring no harm to the surrounding grid. Establishing standard airborne wind models will not only ease the model preparation for interconnection, but the models can be used for long-term planning, real-time control, and future research needs for airborne wind grid integration. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Grid analytics on all time scales, from operations and dispatch to long term planning, would need to be updated to best incorporate the benefits of airborne wind. Powered by those tools, grid adequacy and operating reliability could be evaluated. The results will inform mid- to long-term technology needs to integrate airborne wind into the grid. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Physics of Alternative Wing Structures </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Compliant structures like power kites are new to wind energy but are studied extensively in other contexts (kite sports, sailing, and military air drop [59]). TU Delft [60] and Toyota Research Institute [61] are actively pursuing this topic in the AWE space and have found that the in-flight deformation of fabric kites significantly impacts their aerodynamic performance. Testing and modeling these soft (or semi-rigid, or segmented) structures with high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction computational tools can lead to new physical insight and more accurate engineering models and allow improved design of high-performance and durable soft kites. Since the market has not yet converged around a specific wing architecture, it is not clear that this would be a high-impact activity in the short term, but high-fidelity modeling would play an important role in the development of soft kites. Model validation would require installation of a soft kite prototype with sufficient instrumentation to obtain a series of measurements capturing its motion, deformation, and performance in flight. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Material Inputs </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Many companies use commercially available ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene rope, such as DyneemaTM, for tethers, which is quite strong and light, and floats in water. Fly-gen companies, however, need conducting tethers to transmit power to ground, and these tend to be custom-made. Tether replacement is an expected operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost (potentially annually) for ground-gen systems that repeatedly reel a tether on and off a drum, whereas it is less common for fly-gen systems. Given the significance of O&amp;M costs for ground-gen systems, a common R&amp;D facility, test methods, and tether qualification may provide value to the overall industry as a broader supply chain develops around tethers and tether connectors. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">More broadly, the requirements for constructing and deploying AWES could be examined for the use of critical materials, supply chain constraints, key impediments to scaling and manufacturability, and fundamental physical limitations of known inputs (e.g., high-performance fabric). This analysis could be shared broadly with industry and would inform future technology or materials development efforts. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">System Reliability and Performance </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">To deploy their technology with affordable debt financing like traditional wind energy technology, AWE developers need to demonstrate long-term autonomous operation and failsafe controls (tether failure, icing, rain, hail), among other things. Accelerator programs and fly-off competitions at a shared test site could encourage new industry participants and push existing players toward these goals. Prizes could be awarded for power performance and reliability metrics. Fostering discussion and partnerships between AWE entrepreneurs and established wind energy developers could push AWE technology significantly closer to commercialization.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">R&amp;D Facilities  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">An airborne wind test site is needed to accurately characterize the performance of AWES and allow entrepreneurs to prove the reliability of their systems. A test site can also act as a catalyst for informal collaboration and knowledge sharing [36] and help connect National Laboratories to industry. Instrumentation needs at such a site include the capability to measure wind speeds and other environmental conditions up to 1km above ground level, along with other sensors and infrastructure to characterize the motion, performance, and loads on the test vehicle. Avian radar or other wildlife detection capabilities can enable rigorous wildlife impact assessments. These R&amp;D facilities can evolve over time to support critical subsystem R&amp;D (e.g., tether dynamics and loads, kite structural testing, or material environmental degradation), as well as operational testing for arrays of kites to demonstrate wind farm controls, kite wake effects, and energy production at scale. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Industry R&amp;D </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Many U.S. AWE players are small businesses or entrepreneurs and may be undercapitalized to execute internal R&amp;D projects that would improve the performance or reliability of their products. In addition to R&amp;D funding for these internal priorities, some groups may benefit from access to expert design reviews, test facilities, and certification assistance from the National Laboratories. NRELs Competitiveness Improvement Project [62] has helped meet the R&amp;D needs of the distributed wind industry since 2013 and it (or a similarly framed program) could play an expanded role in AWE as well. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The activities highlighted in  <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Table 3</Reference>  would help better evaluate the system architecture tradeoffs, develop improved physical understanding of AWES operation, and assist the nascent U.S. AWE market in improving the performance, reliability, and scalability of the technology.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"><Figure>  <ImageData src="images/2021 - Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Ene_img_12.jpg"/> Research QuestionActivity Description12345678910How do we evaluate AWE within the energy landscape?Low-order AWE cost and scaling models and integrated system analysis,reference models and controllersStructural and aeroelastic modeling of AWE systems for controls, performance, and loads optimization in turbulenceHigh-fidelity modeling for turbulent inflow, aerodynamics, loads, wakes, and AWE physics understanding; in later years, soft kite modelingHow do we best integrate AWE systems with the grid?Grid impact studies stakeholder engagementPilot-scale demonstration of AWE integration with micro/mini-grid including storageEstablish standard AWE models for grid integrationFull-scale demonstration of hybrid (AWE+storage) systemAre there any potential roadblocks on the AWE developmental path?Critical material inputs, critical component/subsystem capability,  supply chain survey, airspace &amp; groundspace use and restrictionsHow reliable are AWE systems?How reliable can they be?Establish, equip, and staff a permitted flight test site and support facility for AWE power production and reliability testingEnhance test facilities for subcomponents as needs evolve - tether fatigue, kite loads, hybrids, grid integration, multi-kite array, etc.Fly-off with prizes for reliability and performance (100kW200kW scale)Fly-off with prizes for reliability and performance(300kW1MW scale)How to support industry R&amp;D and engagement with national laboratories?Competitive program to fund technology development from TRL 1-6, national lab support available with these awardsTechnology RD&amp;DNotional 10 Year Timeline</Figure> </P>  <H2 id="LinkTarget_731" xml:lang="EN-US">Commercialization </H2>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Standards and Certification </P>  <P
