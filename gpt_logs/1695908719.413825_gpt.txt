RESPONSE:

The research article investigates the impact of airborne wind energy (AWE) on electricity systems. The authors examine the relationship between full load hours (FLHs) and wind classes, revealing that high-wind classes have a greater number of FLHs. This increase is due to the model choice made by the researchers. Section 3.2 discusses the impact of the number of FLHs, power density, and profile value. The small AWE system (sAWES) has a larger number of FLHs than the large AWE system (LAWES), due to the greater area-to-weight ratio of the power-producing wing. This results in a higher marginal system value (MSV) for sAWES compared to LAWES. The better profile value of sAWES also contributes to its superior MSVs, as it provides a more evenly distributed power during the year with fewer zero production hours. This reduces the need for costly thermal peak power generation, improving system value and impacting the final energy mix. For example, in the SE2 region, thermal technologies produce up to 13% more electricity for LAWES than sAWES. However, sAWES has three times lower power density than LAWES, which becomes relevant if local area restrictions limit installations. Certain cases like sAWE-10% and LAWE-10% cannot reach high electricity shares due to limited installation sites. In section 3.3, the authors discuss total wind energy share and wind class allocation. Four key factors impact the competition between AWE and traditional wind turbines (WTs), determining cost-optimal allocation among wind classes within a region. The general trend is cost-optimal to allocate AWE capacity to lower wind-speed classes that have WTs installed and replace WTs in that class. In windy regions (SE2 and IE), this means classes 2-4; in poor wind regions (HU and ES3), WTs are only installed in class 5, where AWESs are also allocated. The allocation strategy takes advantage of the higher FLHs of AWESs relative to WTs and leaves high wind-speed sites to WTs, which show more uniform power generation. The results indicate that it is more cost-effective to place AWESs in low-wind classes, as the difference in profile value between high and low wind classes is greater for WTs than for AWE.
