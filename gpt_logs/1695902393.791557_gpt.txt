RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on the comparison between Wind Turbines (WT) and Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) in terms of Full Load Hours (FLHs). The paper uses various figures and models to represent the optimal annual energy mix for different wind power technologies. The study shows that in regions with wind class five, which are ideal installation sites for WTs, the FLHs are higher for WT than for AWES. Conversely, in the Northern regions, which correspond to lower wind classes, the AWES claim higher FLHs. The paper presents a map of SE2, showing the average FLHs for each technology. It shows that the lowest FLHs in the northern part make those areas more attractive for AWESs, while coastal areas are similar for all wind power technologies. The paper also provides a visualization of the difference between the number of FLHs from AWESs compared to those from WT. An important finding of the study is the significance of wind shear for the performance of AWESs. The greater the wind shear, the greater advantage AWESs have over WTs due to their ability to utilize high-altitude winds and adjustable operation altitude. It was also noted that at locations with similar wind speeds at all altitudes, a low operation altitude is sufficient and WTs show a better power yield due to their lower cut-in wind speed. The article also discusses assumptions and limitations related to modeling scenarios and power generation optimization. It notes that modeling was carried out under perfect foresight on weather and demand conditions, which may underestimate costs of wind integration since thermal power cycling is planned with perfect information available. Two uncertain density factors were identified as relevant to this work: available space and AWE farm density. These factors are dependent on land and airspace.
