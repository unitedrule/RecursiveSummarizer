RESPONSE:

The research article focuses on the computation of the Marginal System Value (MSV) of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) by dividing the change in annual total electricity system cost by the change in installed capacity of AWESs. This calculation helps to estimate the maximum cost of technology for being economically viable in a future emission-free electricity system. The study uses emission constraints and technology costs corresponding to 2050 projections, optimizing capacity installation and electricity production to meet demand at minimal costs and fulfill power plant constraints. The methodology used in this work is inspired by Gansson's model which investigates MSVs for different wind turbine designs and is a follow-up study to Malz et al's work comparing AWESs and Wind Turbines (WTs) in terms of their generation profiles. The results may indicate valuable directions for further AWE technology development and investments. The article is structured into five sections: wind data description, wind power generation technology models, electricity system optimization model, study scenarios, presentation of results, discussion, and conclusion. The study uses high-resolution ERA-5 wind data from ECMWF for all analyzed regions for the year 2012 with an hourly temporal resolution and a horizontal spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25. The AWES model requires wind data at multiple altitudes to generate a vertical wind profile. The vertical wind data are given in 30 model levels (sigma levels), representing specific geopotential above the surface. From the wind data set, 15 relevant vertical wind speed data points are obtained at each time and spatial instance. These wind speeds are processed into a family of smooth polynomial functions of altitude to estimate the wind speeds for the WT at the height of 100 m and to provide a vertical wind profile function to the AWES model. For potential assessment of the two different wind power technologies, their power generation is computed with a WT model and an AWES model. The study assumes that the instantaneous wind speeds in a large wind farm have local differences and are normally distributed over the farm. The standard deviation of the wind speed depends on the structure of the farm, and a standard deviation of 1m/s is assumed in this study. The effect on the wind farm power output is visualized in a figure.
