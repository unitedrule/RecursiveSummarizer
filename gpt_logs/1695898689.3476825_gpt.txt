CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the challenges and opportunities of airborne wind energy (AWE) technologies. The Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) is heavily investing in AWE, with a projected commercialization timeline spanning from 2024 to 2033. However, AWE technology is still relatively immature, and several aspects need to be addressed. The potential for reducing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) has not been validated, as the first commercial units are planned for deployment in 2021. The reliability and availability of an airborne wind energy system (AWES) over extended periods have not been demonstrated. Safety measures, including robust launch and recovery systems and protection against extreme weather conditions, need to be developed for utility-scale deployment. Regulatory and siting concerns related to noise, wildlife impacts, radar mitigation, airspace use, and grid compliance also need to be studied and addressed. AWES must differentiate themselves from traditional wind turbines in terms of energy harvesting characteristics to achieve significant market penetration. These challenges are unique to AWE and require sustained and coordinated research and development efforts. The article acknowledges that AWE is a diverse field with various architectures, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. Design choices play a crucial role in determining the performance and feasibility of AWES architectures. Generator placement is one such design choice that affects the overall system design. In conclusion, while there are significant challenges associated with AWE technologies, they are not viewed as insurmountable. Addressing these challenges through continuous research and development efforts may enable airborne wind energy to have a substantial impact at scale.
