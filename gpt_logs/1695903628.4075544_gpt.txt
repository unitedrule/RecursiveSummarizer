CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research study investigates the value of airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) to the electricity system. The study considers factors such as technology acceptance and requirements on the installation site, which are assumed to be location-independent. Thus, the available installation area isn't location-dependent and these factors can be reflected in the farm power density [MW= km]. The final power density is obtained by multiplying the initial system density (?P) with a density factor (?). This study uses two density factors ? f0:1,1g. For wind turbines, a constant factor of 0.1 is used, signifying that wind parks can be installed at 10% of the available land. Scenarios modelled in each region are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The marginal system value is determined by varying the share of the annual electricity demand supplied by AWESs in all these scenarios, ranging from 0 to 1. Table 2 showcases electricity demand and land surface area available for wind power by region along with properties of large AWES (LAWES), small AWES (sAWES), and wind turbines (WT): capacity, density, and the density factor (?). The regions considered are SE2 (Sweden), ES3 (Spain), IE (Ireland), and HU (Hungary) with varying conditions of windiness and sunniness. Table 3 presents properties of LAWES, sAWES, and WT: their size per unit [MW], farm power density [MW = km], and their respective density factors. To complement marginal system value calculations, an additional approach is taken to investigate AWES's role in electricity systems; a potential cost is assigned to AWES technology, which is varied in different model runs. For a comprehensive comparison, AWES costs (investment and O&amp;M costs) are set relative to WT costs, ranging from 0.5 to 1.2. This approach allows for a more detailed investigation of the relationship between traditional wind turbines and AWESs. In the analysis, sAWES and LAWES are implemented in individual model runs to separate system dynamics, allowing for a clearer interpretation.
