RESPONSE:

A regression model is utilized in this study to estimate the correlation between wind data and power generation. The focus is on calculating power generation from all available wind data, considering the average distribution of wind speeds within a wind farm. The outcome is a standardized potential electricity generation profile for an Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) farm at each spatial grid point. This method was previously employed by Malz et al.,16, resulting in detailed power generation profiles, annual power production, and capacity factor. The distance between individual systems within a farm is presumed to be determined by the maximum tether length, set at 500 m in this study. The downwind direction of an Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES) is defined by the current wind direction, hence the total space needed forms a dome with a radius of the tether length from the ground station. This leads to an AWE farm power density of ?P,sAWE 0:6 and ?P;LAWE 2MW/km. While past research13,36,37 has proposed denser installations by minimizing system spacing based on optimal operation, this study assumes conservative spacing and includes a sensitivity analysis accounting for different farm densities. The study further divides generation profiles into five wind classes using technology models and available wind data, which results in an hourly electricity generation profile over one year for each spatial grid point and modeled technology. Given the high spatial resolution of this data (0.25 x 0.25), it leads to a large data set in the optimization problem, which is managed by grouping generation profiles into five wind classes. This simplification presumes that wind power installations are evenly distributed across each wind class geographically and there's no grid congestion within the region under investigation. Each class is defined by percentiles of average wind speeds at an altitude of 100 m, with each grid point assigned to a class based on its average wind speeds at this height. This implies that each wind class encompasses a certain land surface area. The wind speed interval and land surface area of the classes are detailed in Section 3, Table 3 for each region. In conclusion, all generation profiles of a technology that fall within a certain wind class are averaged to one representative profile of that wind class. Hence, there are five wind classes per region, each comprising a location-independent available land surface area and a representative generation profile for the Wind Turbine (WT), the Small Airborne Wind Energy System (sAWES), and the Large Airborne Wind Energy System (LAWES).
