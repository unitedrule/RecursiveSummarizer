CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The research article presents an in-depth analysis of various technologies and fuels used in the electricity system. The study introduces several variables and parameters for the analysis. The variable gi, t represents the generation of technology i at time step t, si signifies the installed capacity of technology i, and gi,t denotes the active capacity of a technology i at a time t. The parameters include Dt, which signifies the electricity demand of a region at time step t, Lmin that denotes the minimum relative load level for a technology i, and ?P MW 2 which is the power density for either Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) or Wind Turbine (WT). The study also introduces the concept of cycling costs represented by cycl k and part-load cost denoted by cpart load k. It further explains that if a plant i is active, the active generation needs to be larger than the minimum load level Lmin. The start-up capacity gstart at time t of a technology i is constrained by the current active capacity and by the minimum start-up time. The research presents a detailed table (Table B2) outlining the costs of various technologies including Wind Turbine (WT), Solar PV, Hydro, Biogas CCT, Biogas GT, Bio-NG CCS, Nuclear, and Airborne Wind Energy (AWE). The table details aspects like capital cost, variable O&M cost, fixed O&M cost, minimum load, life time and start-up time. The study also introduces cycling costs as a combination of start-up cstart i and part-load costs ci. The total electric power production is constrained by the annual net emissions as Ei gi,t ?Estartgstart ?Epart?gactive gi,t?? Ecap. Ecap represents the total allowed emission in kg of the system in one year.
