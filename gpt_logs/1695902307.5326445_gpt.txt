CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research paper discusses the impact of Full Load Hours (FLHs), power density, and profile value on Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). According to the study, small AWES (sAWES) generate more FLHs than large AWES (LAWES) due to their greater area-to-weight ratio. This is closely linked to a higher Marginal System Value (MSV) for sAWES compared to LAWES. Additionally, sAWES has a better profile value, meaning power is more equally distributed throughout the year with fewer zero production hours. This results in less costly thermal peak power generation and improves system value. For instance, in the SE2 region, electricity production by thermal technologies is up to 13% higher for LAWES compared to sAWES. However, the power density of sAWES is three times lower, which is significant when local area restrictions become limiting. The paper also examines the total wind energy share and wind class allocation. Four key factors (iiv) are identified that impact competition between AWES and traditional Wind Turbines (WTs) and determine cost-optimal allocation of technologies among wind classes within a region. The trend shows it is cost-optimal to allocate AWES capacity to the lowest wind-speed classes with installed WTs and replace WTs in that class. In windy regions such as SE2 and IE, this means classes 2-4. In poor wind regions like HU and ES3, WTs are only installed in class 5 where AWES are also allocated. This approach takes advantage of higher FLHs of AWES relative to WTs and leaves high wind-speed sites to WTs that show more uniform power generation. The study concludes that it's more cost-efficient to place AWESs in lower wind-speed classes due to their superior profile value compared to traditional WTs. This finding is supported by data visualized in Figures 4 and 5, showing FLHs per class for each region and technology, and thermal generation in the SE2 region for all AWES cases respectively. The research cites a previous study16 that also identified a higher profile value for sAWES.
