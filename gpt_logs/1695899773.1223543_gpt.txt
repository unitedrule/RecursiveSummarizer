the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). As an example, in13 the economic potential of an AWE park is evaluated using a quasi-steady flight model for the power curve estimation of the AWES. That work and most other studies5,9,14,15 estimate that AWE technology could offer electricity at a lower LCOE compared to conventional wind turbines. The estimates of the LCOE for AWESs range between roughly 33 and 150 M= Wh. The large span indicates that the actual costs are still highly uncertain. Apart from the LCOE, a crucial aspect of a power generation technology is the electricity generation profile, that is, the distribution of the electricity production in time. The work in Malz et al16 computes the optimal power generation profile of AWESs and the one of traditional wind turbines, using MERRA-2 wind data from different locations. The power generation profiles of the two wind technologies are compared and found to be similar, especially at places with a low wind shear.* </P>  <P>So far, work has focused on assessing wind data for AWES operation, computing the power generation and assessing the economic potential of isolated AWESs. However, the role that AWE could play as a part of the electricity system has not been analysed in detail yet. Apart from the individual power production level of AWES units, their interaction with other power production technologies in the electricity system is of great importance. A generation profile that correlates with the net load of the electricity system has a high economical value. Here, the net load is defined by the system load minus renewable generation. In contrast, electricity generation that is concentrated to a few hours or that enhances the fluctuation of another electricity generation technology might be of less value to the system. Hence, the electricity generation profile of an AWES has a strong impact on its economic value in the electricity system. </P>  <P>The aim of this study is to investigate the economical value of the electricity generation from AWESs in four different regional electricity systems, accounting for the temporal distribution of the electricity. This study focuses on drag-mode AWESs. This type of AWESs generates the electric power by means of propellers on board and transfers it to ground via the tether.2,17 In order to estimate the economical value of drag-mode AWESs, the annual generation profiles of two differently sized AWESs are modelled within four characteristic regions, with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25 0.25 . In Southern Sweden, this relates to an area of approximately 430 km2. Unlike the WT, which is modelled using a power curve for a 2 MW generator, the power generation of AWE is computed via a complex optimal control problem (OCP).16,18,19 This approach accounts for physical limitations, for example, tether drag, and computes the maximal power production and optimal flight trajectory given prevailing wind speeds. The option of optimizing the flight trajectory and the operation height is an important advantage of AWESs compared to conventional WTs.10 </P>  <P>The resulting computed electricity generation profiles are implemented in a regional cost-minimizing electricity system model that is formulated as a linear optimization problem.20 The model is designed to investigate the interaction between different generation, load, and storage technologies and is built as a green-field model, that is, assuming no prior installed capacity. The technologies that are included in the model are coupled to their respective installation and power generation costs. In this study, instead of modelling the AWE technology related to an estimated cost, a certain installed AWE capacity is enforced in the electricity system model. The AWE generation profile is assumed to be a free source of energy. Hereby, the economical value of AWESs to the electricity system can be quantified in terms of the marginal system value (MSV). The MSV is

RESPONSE:

The study investigates the economic value of airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) within four regional electricity systems, considering the temporal distribution of electricity. The research indicates that AWES technology could potentially offer electricity at a lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) compared to traditional wind turbines. However, the actual costs remain uncertain, with estimates ranging between 33 and 150 MWh. The study also highlights the importance of the electricity generation profile of AWESs and how it impacts their economic value in the electricity system. The research focused on drag-mode AWESs, which generate electric power through on-board propellers and transfer it to the ground via a tether, and used a complex optimal control problem to compute power generation. The results were incorporated into a regional cost-minimizing electricity system model that considered various generation, load, and storage technologies. The study concluded that the economic value of AWESs could be quantified in terms of the marginal system value.
