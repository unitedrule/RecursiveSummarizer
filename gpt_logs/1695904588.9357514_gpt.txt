RESPONSE:

The research article titled "The value of airborne wind energy to the electricity system" by Elena C. Malz and her team explores the potential economic value of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) in the future electricity system. AWE is a novel power generation technology that harnesses wind energy at high altitudes using tethered wings. This technology has gained attention due to its potentially higher energy yield and expected lower costs in comparison to traditional wind turbines (WTs). However, due to the unavailability of commercial systems, detailed information on costs and power generation is currently limited. To gain insights into the economic value of AWE, the study uses ERA-5 wind data to calculate the power generation of wind power technologies. This data is then integrated into a cost-minimizing electricity system model. By ensuring that a certain percentage of the annual electricity demand is supplied by AWE systems (AWESs), the study investigates the marginal system value (MSV) of AWE. The MSV represents the economic worth of an additional unit of electricity generated by a specific technology. The results show that the MSV of AWE is affected by several factors: the AWE share, the wind resource, and the temporal distribution of AWES's electricity generation. It was found that the MSV is location- and system-dependent, ranging between 1.4 and 2.2 M= MW at a low share of AWE supply (0%-30%). At higher shares, however, the MSV decreases. The study also finds a relationship between the power generation of WTs and AWESs, signifying that both technologies provide a similar power source and can be used interchangeably. Consequently, unless an AWES cost far below the system-specific MSV is attained, introducing AWESs will have a minimal impact on the cost-optimal wind power share in the electricity system. In conclusion, this research indicates that for AWE to be competitive, certain cost levels are required. As the technology develops and more data becomes available, these findings will be instrumental in shaping the future of AWE and its role in the energy sector.
