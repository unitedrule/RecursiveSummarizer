RESPONSE:

In the research, the power output of wind farms is studied with a focus on Wind Turbine (WT) models and Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) models. The research assumes that in a large wind farm, the instantaneous wind speeds have local differences and are normally distributed over the farm. The standard deviation of the wind speed, which is dependent on the farm's structure, is assumed to be 1m/s. This assumption affects the power output of the wind farm, with a higher standard deviation resulting in smoother cut-in and cut-out points. In the WT model, the power curve of a single turbine is formulated with a rotor diameter of D = 100 m and a generator size of Pcap = 1.94 MW. The specific power of the wind turbine is assumed to be 247 W/m2. The internal and external losses are 0.885 and 0.94 respectively. The efficiency cp is a function of the wind speed vw and varies between 0.18 and 0.45. The cut-in and cut-out wind speeds vin and vout are assumed to be 3m/s and 25m/s respectively. The WT farm's power density is defined by the spacing of the wind turbines. In this study, the distance between turbines is chosen to be seven times the rotor diameter, resulting in an area of 7D x 7D used per turbine. This distance dependency results from wake and shadowing effects of neighboring turbines. For an AWES model, it was noted that the power generation cannot be defined by a machine power curve as it differs from conventional turbines. The normalized instantaneous power produced by a farm was computed using Equation (2). It was found that standard deviation smooths out the power generation curve at cut-in and cut-out wind speeds. This effect was visualized in Figure 1. Given the specific power of wind turbines (247 W/m2), this results in a farm power density of 3.95 MW/km2. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding wind speed distribution and turbine placement in optimizing wind farm power output.
