CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The study explores the potential of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) technologies in complementing traditional and other clean energy sources. It posits that the supply chains for AWE and traditional wind energy are largely independent, suggesting that the development of AWE could alleviate potential supply chain constraints in scenarios of quick clean energy deployment. The research also discusses the viability of AWE for distributed, remote, and disaster applications. Many developers, both in the United States and globally, are focusing on relatively small Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES), rated at 100 kilowatts (kW), intended for distributed, micro-grid, off-grid, or military use. This is due to the global nature of the potential market, the higher value of energy in that market, the need for low-cost design prototypes (many of which are destroyed during testing), and the cost and technology risk perceived by utility scale players that could favor larger designs. The study underscores that AWE can complement solar PV or other distributed energy resources in microgrid applications particularly in remote communities or islands that may not have reliable grid connections or may be reliant on imported diesel fuel. The article further evaluates the viability of AWE for land-based applications. It notes that the potential of AWE as a standalone utility resource on land is sensitive to various performance metrics such as capacity factor, specific power (e.g., kite MW/m2), and power capacity density (e.g., installed MW/km2). It also depends on tether lengths and required safety setbacks from the wind farm to civil infrastructure. The technical potential of AWE is highly uncertain due to these sensitivities and lack of a commercial platform for baseline analysis. However, based on NREL's analysis, a successful land-based AWE product would have traits specific to the areas in which it is deployed. Finally, the paper discusses the viability of AWE for hybrid power plants or repowering. Electricity-producing facilities can potentially benefit from co-locating airborne wind within the footprint of existing or new development. The wake losses of AWE technology are believed to be low, so they could potentially be deployed within the footprint of existing wind farms to increase capacity factor. In older wind farms with smaller turbines, AWES could potentially fly entirely above the existing structures or be part of a repowering solution for older turbines at the end of their design life. The shadow of a kite at relatively high altitude is believed to be minimal and the foundation infrastructure much smaller than traditional.
