RESPONSE:

The research article employs a regression model to estimate the correlation between wind data and power generation, accounting for the normal distribution of wind speeds within a wind farm. This approach is used to calculate power generation from all available wind data, yielding the normalized potential electricity generation profile of an Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) farm for each spatial grid point. This method has been previously used in the work of Malz et al. (16), which provides more detailed results on power generation profiles, annual power production, and capacity factor. The research assumes that the distance between individual systems within a farm is determined by the maximum tether length, set at 500 m in this study. The downwind direction of an Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES) is dictated by the current wind direction, necessitating a dome-shaped total space with a radius of twice the tether length from the ground station. This results in an AWE farm power density of ?P,sAWE 0:6 and ?P;LAWE 2MW/km. Other related studies have proposed denser installations by minimizing system spacing and assuming synchronous operation based on optimal operation (13,36,37). However, this research assumes conservative spacing and includes a sensitivity analysis that considers different farm densities. The technology models and available wind data provide an hourly electricity generation profile over one year for each spatial grid point and each modeled technology. The high spatial resolution of this data (0.25 x 0.25 degrees) results in a large dataset in the optimization problem. To manage this, generation profiles are grouped into five wind classes based on percentiles of average wind speeds at an altitude of 100 m. This categorization assumes that wind power installations are geographically evenly distributed across each wind class and that there is no grid congestion within the investigated region. Each grid point is assigned to a class depending on its average wind speeds at 100 m, with each class representing a certain land surface area. The same land surface area defined for a certain wind class for Wind Turbines (WTs) is also used for that wind class for AWESs. Section 3, Table 3, provides the wind speed interval and land surface area of the different classes for each region. The generation profiles of a technology within a certain wind class are averaged to one representative profile of that wind class. Consequently, there are five wind classes per region, each with a location-independent available land surface area and a representative generation profile for the WT, sAWES, and LAWES.
