RESPONSE:

The research paper investigates the economic value of airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) in a conceptual future electricity system, specifically in terms of their marginal system value (MSV). The study modelled scenarios for four drag-mode AWES cases, with a large wing capacity of 2 MW and a small wing capacity of 0.6 MW, each having both high and low power density factors per land area. The electricity generation profiles of AWESs were obtained by optimizing the flight trajectory of AWESs considering hourly wind conditions at different altitudes. The value of the AWE systems was investigated across four regions, differing in conditions for renewable electricity generation and seasonal distribution of electricity demand. The findings suggest that the MSV of AWESs varies for low electricity shares between 1.3 and 2.2 M=MW with a corresponding LCOE range of 35-45 MWh, which is within the lower bound of AWE costs estimated by previous work. At high shares, the MSV lies between 0.4 and 1 M=MW. The study also found that the total share of wind energy in the electricity system is not increased by introducing AWESs since the power profiles of Wind Turbines (WT) and AWES are very similar, hence one technology simply replaces the other depending on the system cost and eventual system saturation. In regions with good wind conditions, the value of AWE is highest when replacing traditional WTs on poor wind sites, leaving high-wind sites for traditional WTs due to AWES having a higher number of Full Load Hours (FLHs) but a less even generation profile compared to WTs. In less windy regions like HU and ES3, wind power is mostly installed only in the highest wind class due to scarce wind resource availability. For a high system value, factors that should be prioritized include high system power density, a high number of FLHs (relative to WTs), and low variability in the generation profile throughout the year. These factors positively impact the MSV of AWESs and thus promote the eventual commercialization of the technology. The paper suggests future work to investigate the interplay of AWE and the electricity system for other AWES technologies such as the pumping-mode system or the multi-kite AWES. The work should also consider offshore areas and include heating and transport sector as well as storage technologies in the electricity system model, as these factors can change system dynamics and impact on AWES's value.
