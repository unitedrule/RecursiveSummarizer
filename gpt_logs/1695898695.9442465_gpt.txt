to place the electrical generation equipment. If placed onboard (called fly-gen), the airborne device generates power continuously but must transmit the electricity to the ground over the tether connecting the airborne device to the ground. If the generator remains on the ground (called ground-gen), the airborne device can be simpler and lighter, but many designs only generate electricity in one phase of flightcalled reel out, as a tether is spooled from a drumand consume energy during reel in. Ground-gen devices can have a stationary or moving generator, though the former is more commonly proposed.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Wing structure. Second, the structure of the airborne device can be either rigid like most aircraft or soft and compliant like a parafoil kite. Rigid wings can have higher performance and durability but may be heavier. Soft wings sacrifice performance and may have to be regularly replaced due to wear on the fabric, but are lighter and fly slower, and thus are more likely to survive a crash and cause less damage.

The third key design choice is the method of flight operation.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article snippet discusses the design choices and configurations of airborne wind energy systems (AWES). It explains that AWES can be placed onboard the airborne device (fly-gen) or on the ground (ground-gen). Fly-gen devices continuously generate power but need to transmit electricity through a tether, while ground-gen devices are simpler and lighter but only generate electricity during reel out. The structure of the airborne device can be rigid or soft and compliant, with rigid wings offering higher performance and durability but being heavier. Flight operation can be crosswind or relatively stationary. The method of takeoff and landing can vary, including horizontal or vertical launch, or the use of pilot kites or auxiliary systems. The article also mentions 24 potential configurations of AWES, with hybrid approaches being possible. The historical context of airborne wind power is discussed, highlighting the use of kites for various purposes and key innovations in kite technologies. The field of airborne wind accelerated in 2001 with the work of Wubbo Ockels on the Laddermill concept.
