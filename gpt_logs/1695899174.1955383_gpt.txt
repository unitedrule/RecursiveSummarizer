xml:lang="EN-US">The traditional wind turbine industry has benefited from an international standards and certification process that established the performance requirements and operational load cases that the system must survive. These agreed-to criteria lifted an industry from a collection of designs with widely variable reliability, to an industry with predictable performance and ever-increasing reliability. Normal operational conditions of atmospheric shear, veer, and turbulence as a function of elevation could be defined. The most critical need is for a set of atmospheric events that every system must prove it can survive and under which every system must be able to retrieve their kite and bring it safely to stow. Standards for power performance measurement are also critical given that the systems operate at variable altitude. Developing standards or recommended practice for acoustic testing would minimize risk prior to large-scale deployment or deployment near occupied residences. In the near- to medium-term, the United States could support appropriate international efforts for certification of AWES working with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) e.g., IEA WP3: Safety and regulation [39]. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Safety and Regulation </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Many unanswered and understudied questions for AWE relate to safe land and airspace use in and around the AWE installation. Under what conditions may an AWE system overfly a highway? What is the minimum setback distance of residences or infrastructure from an AWE system and how does that depend on the level of redundancy or architecture of the system? What markings or lighting are required to ensure visibility? A 2018 review by Salma et. al. [63] concluded that the regulation framework for AWE systems is not yet mature, and that the framework would likely be shaped by early movers in the industry. Like with certification, safety is a global need and U.S. constituents could both contribute to and leverage appropriate international efforts. There are U.S.-specific regulatory questions which will require engagement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (e.g. [64]) and others <Link>4</Link>  to help answer, and through that engagement the United States may support the proposed IEA TCP Wind Task for Airborne Wind, specifically WP3: Safety and regulation [39]. </P>  <Footnote> <P xml:lang="EN-US">4 Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), International Civil Aviation Organization, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) </P> </Footnote>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Social Acceptance (Noise/Visual) </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Soft kites tend to fly slower than traditional wind turbine blades so are likely quieter. Rigid kites with fly-gen will likely be louder than traditional turbines due to the high speeds of the kites propeller tips. AWE acoustic emissions can be modeled, measured, and considered in deployment scenarios. Proponents suggest that the shadow flicker (the shadow of the kite passing over people and structures on the ground) is much lower with airborne wind than  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">traditional wind. Once visual impact has been quantified, analysis can explore the potential opportunities and economics of wind energy systems that are able to land and effectively disappear from the viewshed. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Environmental Impacts </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">It is generally accepted that traditional wind turbines do not have population-level impacts on migratory birds due to low altitude, but AWE technology has a different visual signature and flight path so the impact warrants study. Some limited research in this area has been done by AWE developers at their test sites (e.g., KiteMill [65] and Makani [66]), but the most complete work, by Bruinzeel, et al., [67] used a probabilistic approach with data from aircraft as an analog for the kite and power lines as an analog for the tether. They estimate that bird fatalities of an average rigid airborne wind system would be comparable to the average wind turbine, but gave a wide range of possible values and did not distinguish between AWE architectures. Other well-studied analogs could be used, such as guy wires on communication towers [68]. Soft kites may have an advantage as they tend to fly slower and may deform to cushion any impact, but the tether would be no less dangerous.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">U.S. research could start with similar but broader first-order analysis to better understand the challenge and help define the needed field campaigns. Pre-construction wildlife surveys could be completed on any new AWE installation, but beginning monitoring before there is an AWE with reliable operation is unnecessary, which puts fieldwork several years in the future. Given the potentially large areas swept by a long tether, technology development may be needed as part of the monitoring solution e.g., fiber-optic monitoring, kite- or ground-station- mounted sensing, or thermal imaging for falling carcasses. When a pre-commercial or prototype site is operating continuously, wildlife interactions can be observed to validate impact and fatality estimates. As needed, researchers and industry can develop techniques or technology to minimize collisions with wildlife, e.g., adjusting flight altitude or flight path to avoid songbirds or landing during significant wildlife activity. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">The IEA airborne wind task proposal includes WP4: Social Acceptance [39], which studies these topics and more, and can be supported by U.S. efforts. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Radar Interference </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">AWES, like traditional wind turbines, will have to address concerns about radar interference. However, if curtailed due to radar, AWES may have to landpotentially increasing the financial loss for the operator associated with curtailment. Existing processes for assessing wind turbine radar interference are applicable to AWE and are likely to be sufficient in driving stakeholder awareness and determining the radar impact of various AWE architectures (soft, rigid fly-gen, and rigid ground-gen) on a relative basis. If radar is more sensitive to AWE systems, then follow-on R&amp;D work could consider ways to minimize the interference.  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">  </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Workforce Development </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">To address workforce development in undergraduate programs, the existing and successful Collegiate Wind Competition could be a model for an AWE collegiate competition  one that would make use of simulation tools or test facilities proposed elsewhere. At the post-graduate level, creating one or more centers of excellence at U.S. universities, where a cohort of masters or doctoral students work on different aspects of the airborne wind challenge, could quickly advance the state of the art in the United States, and provide a supply of talented researchers to industry and the national laboratory system. For installation and O&amp;M, the skillsets of the existing (and growing) wind turbine technician workforce somewhat overlap with the skill requirements for AWE, but the ability to perform maintenance at ground level means the jobs are safer and less physically taxing. A workforce-related benefit is that the O&amp;M needs of airborne wind may be substantially higher than traditional wind, potentially increasing the number of permanent local jobs. To the extent that additional skillsets are needed (e.g., power electronics, drones), the growing workforce of electric vehicle maintainers and the popularity of maker spaces and drones may help increase the number of qualified candidates. If the industry begins serial production and operation of high-throughput facilities, these assumptions could be revisited, and the development of technical school or community college curricula may be considered. </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Policy Levers </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Conventional wind energy in the United States has benefited immensely from the Production Tax Credit. However, AWE is a very different technology, has a much lower TRL and higher cost basis, and it is appropriate to treat it separately from conventional wind energy for the purposes of policy support. It is worth careful study as to which policy or financial incentives are most appropriate for an energy technology that has not yet achieved convergence around a specific architecture. Would such incentives be helpful or hurtful at this stage? At what stage could they be introduced for cost-effective results? </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">To help AWE to address the commercialization needs above over a ten-year time frame, a series of activities is summarized in  <Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Table 4</Reference> . </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>  <P xml:lang="EN-US"><Figure>  <ImageData src="images/2021 - Challenges and Opportunities for Airborne Wind Ene_img_13.jpg"/> Research QuestionActivity Description12345678910How can we standardize the terminology, design, testing, and certification to enhance bankability and insurability?Support international AWE standards development with U.S. industry, IEC, etc.What are standard safety practices that should be followed for siting and operation of AWE?U.S. stakeholder engagement: OSHA / BSEE / FAA / industryfeed into IEA Task WP3What are the human impacts of significant AWE development?Modeling and experimental campaigns (acoustics, flicker, lighting, visual impact, IEA Task WP4)What is the impact of AWE on birds, bats and other wildlife?Literature survey and analysis to bound the problem with various AWE architectures, plan monitoring campaign for test siteField monitoring campaign at test site and early pre-commercial site once continuous operation is achievedDevelop technologies to measure and mitigate wildlife impacts as neededWhat are the effects of AWE on radar stakeholders?Extend interagency Wind Turbine-Radar Interference Mitigation Working Group to include AWEDetermine relative impact of AWE concepts on radar and develop mitigation measures, as needed, to reduce interferenceHow can we train U.S. workers for jobs created in this sector?Center of Excellence for AWE, supporting MS and PhD'sNew AWE Collegiate Wind CompetitionDevelop additional AWE-specific curricula for technical schools and community collegesWhat kinds of policy and financial incentives are appropriate for AWE?Study historical impact of policy levers on energy technologies similar to AWE, recommend policy for out-yearsCommercializationNotional 10 Year Timeline</Figure> </P>  <H1 id="LinkTarget_697" xml:lang="EN-US">VI. Conclusion </H1>  <P xml:lang="EN-US">Fully answering the question posed by Congress regarding the viability of airborne wind to provide a significant source of energy in the United States requires some consideration of how quickly AWE might contribute as a source of energy. For airborne wind, a nascent, unproven technology, to achieve significant commercial success by 2035 would require a rapid expansion of R&amp;D activities and an acceleration of commercialization that is unprecedented in energy production technology. For a sense of scale, Federal support of wind energy research dates back over four decades, the wind production tax credit almost three decades, and it has taken nearly that long for wind to become commercially competitive across much of the country. AWE becoming a significant source of energy by 2050 is possible, but the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines (for AWE and other clean technologies) and the evolution of the U.S. power


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the challenges and opportunities for airborne wind energy (AWE) in the United States. It highlights the importance of international standards and certification processes in ensuring the reliability and performance of AWE systems. The article also emphasizes the need for safety regulations, including determining setback distances from residences and infrastructure, visibility requirements, and addressing noise and visual impact concerns. Environmental impacts, particularly on migratory birds, are discussed, and it is suggested that further research and monitoring are needed to assess the impact of AWE systems. Radar interference and workforce development are also addressed in the article. The authors propose various activities to support the commercialization of AWE over a ten-year timeframe. However, it is noted that achieving significant commercial success for AWE by 2035 would require unprecedented R&D activities and rapid commercialization. The conclusion highlights the uncertainty in estimating technology cost declines and the timeline for AWE to become a significant source of energy in the United States.
