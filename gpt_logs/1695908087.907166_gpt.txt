RESPONSE:

The research article by Elena C. Malz from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Signals and Systems, Chalmers University, Sweden, investigates the future economic value of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) in the electricity system and its competitiveness with traditional wind turbines (WTs). AWE is a new technology that harvests wind energy at high altitudes using tethered wings. The study uses ERA-5 wind data to compute the power generation of wind power technologies and implements this data into a cost-minimizing electricity system model. By forcing a certain percentage of the annual electricity demand to be supplied by Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs), the research explores the marginal system value (MSV) of AWE, which is found to be influenced by the AWE share, wind resource, and temporal distribution of AWES's electricity generation. The MSV of AWE varies between 1.4 and 2.2 M= MW at a low AWE supply share (0%30%). At higher shares, MSV decreases. The study reveals that the power generation of WTs and AWESs are related, indicating that these technologies can serve as similar power sources and can be used interchangeably. However, the introduction of AWESs will minimally impact the cost-optimal wind power share in the electricity system unless an AWES cost significantly below the system-specific MSV is achieved. AWE technology is still in its early stages and has been investigated by industry and academia for over a decade. Although AWESs use less material than WTs and are expected to yield higher energy due to greater wind speeds at high altitudes, these expectations are based solely on estimations as AWE is not yet commercially available. The industry aims for both small-scale off-grid solutions and large-scale installations. The large-scale deployment of any technology heavily depends on its cost and electricity generation compared to other technologies. The economic potential of power generation technologies is commonly compared using reanalyses wind data resources and Lidar wind speed measurements.
