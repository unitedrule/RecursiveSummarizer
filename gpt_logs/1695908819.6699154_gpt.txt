windy regions, the large AWES always has fewer FLHs than the WTs. Together with the low profile value, the resulting MSV of LAWESs is always below the reference cost of WTs (Figure 2B,D). </P>  <P>In order to visualize the wind technology allocations, the results of varying the AWE costs in the model are shown for some illustrative scenarios in Figure 6. In the figures, the electricity production mix is displayed for a range of relative AWE system costs [0.5, 1.2]. </P>  <P>Figure 6A,B shows the optimal mix of the electricity production for the region SE2 in Sweden, meeting the annual electrical energy demand of 92,491 GWh. The surplus wind and solar production that is curtailed is not displayed. The optimal electricity mix consists of approximately 50% wind power, 13% hydro power, and 37% thermal power generation. </P>  <P>For clarification, these plots can be linked to the MSV results in Figure 2. The optimal energy mix for the case of equal costs for AWESs and WTs (relative cost AWE/WT = 1) in Figure 6A yields an AWE share of the electricity mix of 0.1. Considering an AWE share of 0.1 in Figure 2A, one can observe that the MSV of AWE equals the costs of WTs. Thus, one can find the same results in both figures, illustrating different perspectives and resolutions. </P>  <P>The result of this analysis highlights and confirms the two findings presented in the previous section. Firstly, AWE has to be much cheaper relative to WT in order to increase the total wind energy share. Secondly, AWE systems are preferentially allocated to the low wind-speed sites, while the WTs take the high wind-speed sites. </P>  <P>The first finding can be observed from the total share of wind energy in each modelled scenario. Unless the AWES is much cheaper or achieves a high power density, the total share of 50% wind power generation in SE2 is constant for all scenarios. Figure 6A shows that AWE becomes economical as soon as its cost matches the costs of traditional WTs (rel.cost = 1). If both technologies are part of the electricity production one technology replaces the other. This implies that the total share of wind power in the system does not change, even if AWE becomes economically viable. In fact, in the vast majority of the investigated cases, the AWESs simply replace traditional wind turbines as the cost of the AWES is reduced. This competition between the two technologies is explained by their very similar electricity generation profiles. Figure 6B presents the energy mix with the sAWES. The difference to the LAWES case is that due to its large number of FLHs, its installation is economical, even if it becomes more costly than traditional wind. However, also in this case, the total share of 50% wind power is not exceeded; traditional wind in in class 4 is simply replaced by AWE capacity. </P>  <P>The second finding concerning the allocation of the wind power technologies into the different wind classes is also observable in Figure 6. If WTs and AWESs are both part of the system, WTs take the high wind-speed areas while AWE systems take the low wind-speed areas. Only for the exception of very low AWE costs, for example, in Figure 6A, AWE is present in wind class 5. However, this class-5 area is assigned to traditional WTs if they are part of the total electricity production. Figure 6B suggests that a share of AWE is useful at all modelled cost levels, but in all cases the high wind-speed sites are equipped with WTs only. </P>  <P>As a last illustration, the FLHs of the different technologies are mapped over the SE2 region in Figure 7. </P>  <P>Note that a high number of FLH does not necessarily imply a good performance at low wind speed. The FLHs might be obtained by production concentrated on the medium and high wind speed hours. Coastal sites and Lake V?nern at location N59'E13' present equally good sites for all systems, that is, the FLHs are similar, and partly better for the WT (Figure 7A) than for the big AWE system (Figure 7C).


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The research article discusses the comparison and allocation of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) and Wind Turbines (WTs) in windy regions. The study reveals that AWES have fewer full-load hours (FLHs) compared to WTs, leading to a lower marginal system value (MSV) for large AWES (LAWES) than the reference cost of WTs. The study presents various scenarios to illustrate the allocation of wind technology based on variations in AWES costs. The electricity production mix is shown for a range of relative AWES system costs between 0.5 and 1.2. For region SE2 in Sweden, the optimal electricity mix is found to consist of approximately 50% wind power, 13% hydro power, and 37% thermal power generation, meeting an annual electrical energy demand of 92,491 GWh. When the costs for AWES and WTs are equal (relative cost AWE/WT = 1), the AWES share of the electricity mix is approximately 0.1, with an MSV equal to the costs of WTs. This provides two primary findings: firstly, AWES must be significantly cheaper than WTs to increase the total wind energy share; secondly, AWES systems are preferably located in low wind-speed sites while WTs are allocated to high wind-speed sites. The research indicates that unless AWES is much cheaper or achieves high power density, the total share of 50% wind power generation remains constant across all scenarios. As soon as the cost of AWE matches traditional WTs, AWE becomes economical. However, it does not change the total share of wind power in the system even if it becomes economically viable. Instead, AWES often replace traditional wind turbines as their cost reduces due to their similar electricity generation profiles. In terms of location allocation, WTs are assigned to high wind-speed areas while AWE systems occupy the low wind-speed areas, except in cases of very low AWE costs. Lastly, the study maps the FLHs of different technologies over the SE2 region showing that a high number of FLH does not necessarily imply good performance at low wind speed. Coastal sites and Lake V?nern present equally good sites for all systems, with FLHs being similar and sometimes better for WTs than for big AWE systems.
