The Senate has passed a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide for corporate tax reform, including a new corporate alternative minimum tax and exemptions for certain corporations. The bill would also establish a program to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part B and D enrollees, and set maximum prices for selected drugs. Additionally, the bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to increase the initial coverage limit and out-of-pocket threshold for 2025, and requires drug manufacturers to provide rebates for drugs with prices that increase faster than inflation. The bill also establishes a program to provide discounts on prescription drugs for certain Medicare beneficiaries. Finally, the bill extends and modifies the credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act both provide tax incentives for businesses to invest in clean energy production. These credits are available for solar and wind energy facilities, nuclear energy production, alternative fuel vehicles, energy efficient buildings, and industrial facilities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Energy Act of 2020 and the Clean Air Act appropriate funds for various clean energy initiatives and programs to help communities adapt to climate change. The Climate Resilience and Livable Communities Act also authorizes various programs to help communities adapt to climate change and provides funding for infrastructure to support them.
