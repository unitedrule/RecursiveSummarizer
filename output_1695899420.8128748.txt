The research article snippet discusses the closure of Makani Windpower in 2020, which was a significant event in the airborne wind energy sector. Makani, founded in 2006, had received funding from Google and ARPA-E and had developed a 20kw fly-gen demonstrator called Wing 7. The company was acquired by Google X in 2013 and designed a new kite known as the M600, which was scaled up to 600kw. However, the M600 underperformed in flight testing, primarily due to aerodynamic issues and the kite's inability to fly small circles. Additionally, the declining cost of land-based wind energy eroded Makani's cost advantage, leading them to pivot towards floating offshore wind. This pivot may have affected their focus on improving kite performance. The decision to fly the M600 from a floating buoy offshore also presented new challenges. Makani's shift from their original soft kite concept to a rigid wing, fly-gen architecture may have limited their exploration of design possibilities. Funding pressure from Alphabet and Shell, which required achieving technical milestones for continued support, also played a role in the closure. Lessons learned from Makani's experience highlight the importance of understanding specific AWE architectures, making strategic decisions, and managing funding pressure. Despite Makani's closure, further exploration of AWE concepts is still encouraged.
