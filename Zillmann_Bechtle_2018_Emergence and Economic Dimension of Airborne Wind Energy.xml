<H3>Chapter 1 Emergence and Economic Dimension of Airborne Wind Energy </H3>

<P>Udo Zillmann and Philip Bechtle </P>

<P>Abstract Airborne wind energy has the potential to evolve into a fundamental cornerstone of sustainable electricity generation. In this contextual analysis we discuss why this technology is emerging at this very moment in time and why it has the potential to disrupt the wind energy economy in the short term and the global energy markets in the longer term. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the economic dimension of this scenario. Following this introductory chapter, the current technology status, principles and challenges of designing, building and ﬂying</P>

<H4>1.1 A Digital Product Conquers the Air: Drones </H4>

<P>Drones will eventually be “as ubiquitous as pigeons”, futurist Liam Young recently 
<Link>predicted [10]. Even </Link>
now, drones are omnipresent. They ﬁrst belonged to the realm of the military and were unaffordable for anyone else. Today, they have become so inexpensive that hobbyists and even children can afford them. Drones have conquered the extreme ends of the market for technical goods: multimillion dollar military drones as well as low-cost consumer products. Between these two extremes lies the market for commercial drones, which is still largely untapped. It is our aim to change this dramatically. We have presented the subject at the 6th International 
<Link>Airborne Wind Energy Conference (AWEC) 2015 [79] and discussed it in [78]. </Link>

<P id="LinkTarget_3841">While much has been written and speculated about a huge commercial market for drones, it is quite uncertain to which uses commercial drones might be put. A drone in this sense is every autonomous ﬂying object, and such broadly deﬁned drones can be used for a surprising variety of tasks. Much media attention was paid to Amazons’, Google’s and DHL’s announcement of using delivery drones. The use of drones in surveillance e.g. for detecting ﬁres, cracks in pipelines or illegal wood logging can already be considered a classic use 
<Link>of drones [5, 36]. Drones </Link>
can also monitor farmland in detail for precision farming. Autonomous solar powered drones can be used to hover at high altitude over an area for months to provide wireless communication similar to a satellite. Facebook and Google have invested in startup companies in this ﬁeld. Also there is the potential to replace pilot-controlled aircraft for the transportation of humans or goods with drones, as investigated e.g. 
<Link>by NASA [8] </Link>
or 
<Link>Joby Aviation [48]. </Link>
</P>

<P>But there are other disruptive uses for autonomous ﬂying objects—or drones—of which the current debate is largely unaware. </P>

<P>One example is Elon Musk and his company SpaceX. He is successfully working on routinely landing and later reusing Falcon rockets after they have delivered their payload into space. It is impossible for a pilot to control a precision upright landing of a rocket that literally falls out of the sky with several times the speed of sound. Only cutting-edge drone technology can do this. If the rocket was to be recycled it would lower the ﬂight costs from the cost of building a rocket to the cost of refueling 
<Link>it. That is US$ 200,000 instead of US$ 55 million [68]. </Link>
</P>

<P>The business potential for such a “rocket drone” is enormous. And it is clear that once such reusable rockets exist, other rocket manufacturers cannot compete any more on the basis of their non-reusable rockets. Digital drone technology completely disrupts the rocket market. In fact it already has, even before SpaceX managed to reuse a single rocket. In a reaction to a failed landing attempt of SpaceX both western rocket manufacturers, United Launch Alliance and Airbus Defense and Space, announced that they will develop new rocket systems with the capability to land and reuse 
<Link>at least the most costly parts of the rocket [18]. After the ﬁrst successful </Link>

<Link>landings of Falcon rockets [77] (and others [11]) their commitment to this decision </Link>
was surely reinforced. </P>

<H4>1.2 The Airborne Wind Energy Device: A “Wind Drone” </H4>

<P>A similar disruption is to be expected in the wind energy market by AWE devices. It was Miles Loyd who ﬁrst worked on the idea of airborne wind 
<Link>energy [51] dur</Link>
ing the energy crises of the late 1970s at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He had the radical idea of building a wind generator without a tower, only using a ﬂying wing connected to the ground by a tether, much like a kite. A sketch of such a device is shown in Fig. 
<Link>1.1. </Link>
His basic idea was very simple: the aerodynamically most efﬁcient part of a wind turbine is the outermost area of the blades, since it harvests the wind from the largest effective area compared to its own size. </P>

<P>Fig. 1.1 The fundamental idea of airborne wind energy, here exempliﬁed using the most common form of a crosswind device, as 
<Link>imagined by Miles Loyd [51]: </Link>
use a tethered wing on a tether to replace the blade tips of a wind turbine, generating electricity either in drag mode (left) or in lift mode. For the latter the wing is mostly operated in a pumping cycle, alternating between reel-out of the tether (center) and reel-in (right) </P>
</Caption>
</Figure>

<P>Would it be possible to just keep this area, and do away with all the inefﬁcient rest of the blades, and the huge tower? The simple answer is a crosswind AWE device. If an automatically—that is autonomously—ﬂown kite or tethered aircraft ﬂies perpendicularly to the wind while pulling on the tether, it can either harvest the wind energy via repellers and generators on board (the “drag mode”) or via pulling the tether out against the force of a generator on ground (the “lift mode”). For a more detailed introduction into the physics of current implementations of AWE see 
<Link>[21] </Link>

<Link>and other chapters of the 2013 AWE book [3]. This fundamental idea, once it works, </Link>
opens entirely new realms of wind energy: there is no direct constructive limitation on the area swept by the wind energy device anymore. Instead of optimizing it for efﬁciency in a given area, as the rotor disk of a wind turbine, it can be optimized for total energy output. Thus it sweeps larger areas than wind turbines, using only a tiny fraction of the material, and with the theoretical potential to go to higher altitudes with less intermittent wind than the area of about 100 to 200 meters above ground accessible to wind turbines. </P>

<P>Miles Loyd calculated the expected energy output of his “ﬂying wind generator”. Based on the formula he ﬁrst established—today known as Loyd’s Formula—he found that a tethered aircraft with the size, weight and aerodynamics of one of the largest aircraft of the 1970s could produce 6.7 MW of power. Even larger wings with an output of 45 MW seemed feasible. Loyd ﬁled a 
<Link>patent [53] and published </Link>
the now famous 
<Link>article [51] on </Link>
this new technology. </P>

<P>But here the story of Miles Loyd ends. He also wanted to build a ﬂying wind generator but could not ﬁnd funding. Not because the physics would have been wrong, but because—amongst many challenges—he had no answer to one question: how to control such a ﬂying wing without a pilot? </P>

<P>Today, we have a technology that lets us control ﬂying objects without a pilot. It is called: drones. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_3842">If we apply this new technology to Loyd’s old formula we can build a new type of drone: we call this the “wind drone”. </P>

<P>Miles Loyd explained in his foreword to the 2013 AWE Book that his computer 
<Link>at the time had 64 kByte of RAM [52]. Today, </Link>
a personal computer in everybody’s home usually has 8 to 16 GByte of RAM, so computing power has increased by about one million times, if roughly estimated by RAM size. It was impossible for Miles Loyd to build an airborne wind energy device that could ﬂy the required patterns autonomously, adapt to the wind gusts and changes in direction and to autonomously start and land with the computing power and sensor technology of the 1970s. Only after the turn of the millennium did drone technology become powerful enough that turning Miles Loyd’s invention into reality started to become feasible. It is no coincidence that we saw the establishment of the ﬁrst research teams at Universities at this time and shortly thereafter the establishment of the ﬁrst generation of AWE companies like Makani Power, Ampyx Power, Kitegen, Enerkite and so many others. </P>

<P>This is also the reason why all AWE devices can be rightfully called “wind drones”: No matter whether they are controlled from the ground or from the ﬂying object, or whether they are rigid or soft, or whether they are almost stationary or crosswind devices: all of them are or ultimately will be autonomously controlled ﬂying objects, hence they are drones. Drones on a leash, that is. And their advent is made possible by the same technological revolution which also made autonomous free-ﬂying drones and autonomously landing rocket drones possible: the tremendous increase in the precision of smaller and lighter sensors, and of computing power over the last decades. </P>

<P>But even in the last decade, since the ﬁrst practical AWE projects started, Moore’s law continued to do its work and computing power has since doubled roughly every </P>

<P>2.7 years. Today, a lack of drone and control technology is no longer the main obstacle to AWE that it once was. Today, drone and control technology is the enabler for AWE. </P>

<H4>1.3 Airborne Wind Energy in 2017 </H4>

<P>A lot has happened in the last decade in the area 
<Link>of wind drones [17]. Small-scale </Link>
wind drone prototypes were built by many research teams and companies and have been ﬂying for many years. Makani, which had been acquired in 2013 by Google and is currently one of the “moonshot” projects of the Alphabet subsidiary X, is the ﬁrst company to take the next step towards the approximate scale of present commercial wind turbines. It has already built a fully functional demonstrator with 
<Link>600 kW output, 26 m wingspan and a mass of 2 tons. Illustrated in Fig. 1 and detailed </Link>

<Link>in [56], this demonstrator is currently being tested and will be installed in </Link>
a wind 
<Link>park in Hawaii [7, 58]. </Link>
</P>

<P>Makani will be ﬁrst to show a wind drone with power outputs comparable to today’s wind turbines. But they are not the only ones who have realized that drone </P>

<P>technology is now ripe to take on Loyd’s formula. Several companies, including for example 3M, ABB, Alstom, E.ON, Honeywell, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Sabic, Shell, Softbank and Statkraft, have conducted research on wind drones and/or ﬁnanced one of the dozens of AWE startups worldwide. An overview of these and more is shown

<Link>development activities is displayed in Fig. 2 of the preface </Link>

the potential “magic solution” for the energy problem and named it one of his best bets for a game-changing 
<Link>energy breakthrough [2, 50]. </Link>
</P>

<P>How can one be conﬁdent that wind drones become a success? It is a logical combination of two factors: one is the understanding that drone technology is mature enough to build wind drones. The other is the understanding that the economic </P>

<Sect>
<H4>1.4 The Success Formula of Wind Drones: Replacing Concrete and Steel with Cleverness </H4>

<P>It is drone technology that makes building wind drones possible, but it is a mechanical reason that makes them so competitive with wind turbines: wind drones can be built without large lever arms. </P>

<P>If horizontal axis wind turbines are analyzed from a structural perspective they can be seen as a combination of four large lever arms. The tower is a cantilever beam that needs to support the horizontal aerodynamic loading of the entire turbine. Similarly, the three rotor blades need to support the generated aerodynamic forces.
<Link>1 </Link>
Wind energy currently holds the world record in building the longest cantilevering structure, at about 220 m from base of the tower to 
<Link>the tip of the blade [61]. This </Link>
principle works well due to a tremendous amount of good engineering, but if there is a chance to avoid it, a lot can be gained by omitting all the aerodynamically unnecessary material. A graphical sketch of the lever arm problem of conventional wind is shown 
<Link>in Fig. 1.3. </Link>
</P>

<P>1 The rotational motion contributes an apparent centrifugal stiffening effect </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_3844">Wind drones on the other hand, can be built in a way that the tether is almost parallel to the generated aerodynamic force. In addition, in some wind drone designs the tethered wing or kite can be supported by a bridle line system to even reduce lever arms on the wing itself, allowing for very lightweight structures. The mechanical fact that wind drones can be built as tensile structure without such huge lever arms has two important economic implications: ﬁrst, wind drones can be built in a substantially less massive way than wind turbines and second, wind drones can be built to reach the winds at higher altitudes. </P>

<P>Therefore, the comparison between wind turbines and wind drones is easy: wind turbines achieve mechanical stability with the help of very unfortunate lever arms. Wind drones replace mechanical stability with autonomous cleverness to stay up in the air. </P>

<P>Of course, the drastic change of the operating model of wind energy, from a ﬁxed structure to a dynamically controlled tethered aircraft, comes with a set of challenges and possible downsides. Amongst them is also the question of aviation regulations. Together with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), companies like Ampyx Power are working on addressing these issues. The use of wind drones for wind energy generation is already mentioned in EASA’s 
<Link>risk assessments [26]. </Link>
</P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>1.5 An Order-Of-Magnitude Comparison of Capital Costs </H4>

<P>The omission of a large lever arm makes it possible to build very lightweight wind drones. This means that wind drones can be expected to be cheaper to build than wind turbines, once large-scale production begins. Half of the total capital costs of wind turbines, which make up the bulk of the total costs of wind energy, are the costs for the massive structural elements, the tower, the blades, the foundation and 
<Link>the rotor hub [44].</Link>

<Link>2 </Link>
Within the costs for these components the material costs rather than production costs dominate. The material effort is extremely high: up to 700 tons of steel are used for the tower, 
<Link>another 100 tons of steel for the rotor hub [72], </Link>
up to 100 tons 
<Link>of glass ﬁber reinforced plastic for the blades [62], and up </Link>
to 4000 tons of concrete for the foundation of a single wind turbine.
<Link>3 </Link>
An overview over the cost components of these components is given 
<Link>in Fig. 1.4. </Link>
</P>

<P>Thanks to the efﬁcient geometry of wind drones, they lack these massive structures. The tower is replaced by a thin tether. A wind drone with the power of the largest currently existing wind turbine (8 MW) requires a tether that is 6 cm 
<Link>thick [21]. Without bending moments only minimal foundations </Link>
are needed and the wings can be much lighter, requiring only 1 to 10% of the material of the blades of a wind turbine.
<Link>4 </Link>
The Google Makani 600 kW wing weighs 2 tons including the 
<Link>tether and on-board generators [38]. A 600 kW wind turbine weighs between 50 and </Link>

<P>In comparison, the required components for power generation are cheap: the costs for the electricity producing generator amounts to less than 3% of total costs. Certainly, wind drones will need more and better sensors, processors and other control components, but these cost much less than the materials saved. As a result, and in the absence of public prices for grid-scale energy production with a commercial AWE system, this order-of-magnitude comparison suggests that a wind drone can be built for about half the costs of a wind turbine with the same rated power. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>1.6 High-Altitude Wind Resource </H4>

<P>Since wind drones are not restricted by lever arms, they can ﬂy higher than the hub height of a wind turbine. Wind drones could easily reach altitudes twice to four times as high as normal wind turbine towers, so 300 to 600 m instead of 150 m. On average the wind speed increases with altitude. And higher wind speed means more wind power. Since wind power increases with the cube of the wind speed, doubling the wind speed therefore means that wind power is multiplied by a factor of eight. </P>

<P>The difference the altitude makes can be clearly seen from the wind data measured above central London shown 
<Link>in Fig. 1.5. Even </Link>
at 120 m altitude, London city is a reasonably good wind resource with an average wind speed of 7.0 m/s. But at 250 m altitude, this ﬁgure increases to 9.3 m/s. Due to the cubic relationship, wind </P>

<Link>been measured by [22] </Link>
over a period of 4578 hours using a Doppler lidar. The wind power density is calculated using this wind speed data in conjunction with the barometric altitude formula for </P>

<Link>height [71]. </Link>
The reason for this similarity between offshore wind sites and high-altitude wind is simple: obstacles on land like forests, hills and buildings slow the wind down. Offshore winds partly owe their strength to the lack of obstacles. The same applies to high-altitude winds: no obstacles exist to slow the winds down. At a height of 500 m, the average wind speed is 11.6 m/s and wind power again approximately doubles to 924 W/m2 with respect to a height of 250 m. This is a higher average wind speed than any operational offshore wind park in the world can offer.
<Link>5 </Link>
</P>

<P>Flying wind drones directly above the city center of London might not be very realistic, but the ability of wind drones to harvest high-altitude winds leads to three important economic implications that will become relevant. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>1.7 Higher Energy Production means Lower Energy Price </H4>

<P>The cost of wind energy depends not only on the cost to install a wind turbine with a certain capacity but also on the amount of energy this wind turbine produces. This is why wind energy is affordable at good wind sites but expensive at less windy </P>

<P>5 The highest wind speed of any operational offshore wind park 
<Link>worldwide is 10.46 m/s [1], and it </Link>
was only achieved by building a ﬂoating wind turbine (Hywind Project) that is anchored in 200 m deep waters. </P>

<P>sites. Due to strong winds, offshore wind turbines often run at full capacity and do not stay idle much. The average energy production of offshore turbines is therefore twice as high as that of onshore turbines with the same rated capacity. 
<Link>[44]. The so-</Link>
called capacity factor of offshore turbines, which is the percentage of a power plant’s maximum potential that is actually achieved over time is therefore twice as high as for onshore turbines. But since offshore turbines cost two to three times as much as onshore turbines, the advantage of higher production with the same nameplate capacity does not result in lower costs per kWh. Offshore wind energy is still more 
<Link>costly than onshore wind [44]. </Link>
</P>

<P>According to research conducted by E.ON, Germany’s largest utility, offshore wind drones can even boost the offshore wind turbines’ high yields by another 50%. Their capacity factor can be as high as 69% per annum 
<Link>[59]. In </Link>
many onshore locations the advantage for wind drones is even higher and capacity factors can more than double compared to wind turbines. This was also shown in a recent study by EWC Weather Consult, in which the expected capacity factor of the Enerkite wind 
<Link>drone EK200 [24] </Link>
was analyzed for a deployment in Germany, taking into account the local and temporal variation of the wind speed at different altitudes over the duration of two years. The result is shown 
<Link>in Fig. 1.6 [27]. It </Link>
can be seen that for most of Germany the capacity factor is above 60%, and for all of the Netherlands it is even above 75%.
<Link>6 </Link>
This compares to a current average capacity factor of 18.3% for 
<Link>wind turbines in Germany [12]. </Link>
</P>

<P>So, wind drones could be cheaper to install while producing more. Under the assumption that installation costs per kW would be reduced by half and that output per installed kW would be doubled at the same time, the price per kWh of electricity </P>

<P>6 It should be noted that the Enerkite EK200 is optimized towards high capacity factor. A comparison between a wind turbine and a wind drone optimized towards high power output can be found 
<Link>in Fig. 1.9. </Link>

This would make wind drones highly competitive with wind turbines. It would also make wind drone energy cheaper than energy from fossil fuels. </P>

<P>This gain in competitiveness does not only mean a big difference for the individual investor or purchaser of energy, but also for the global world economy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that in order to implement the climate investment pledges made to the UN by world leaders, the global energy industry 
<Link>must invest $ 13.5 trillion through 2030 [41]. Savings in the order of trillions of dol</Link>
lars could be made if airborne wind energy was used to provide the energy at least partially. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>1.8 Offshore-Quality Wind—Almost Everywhere! </H4>

<P>The higher average wind speed and the cubic dependency of wind power on the wind speed means that many sites open up for wind energy production that, at the hub height of wind turbines, do not have a wind resource that is suitable for economic wind energy generation. The wind maps of Germany at 100 and 200 m altitude depicted in Fig. 
<Link>1.7 </Link>
show the dramatic improvement of the wind resource with altitude. The maps only show areas with a good wind resource in excess of 350 W/m2. At 100 m only the north of Germany can offer such good wind sites, while at 200 m the majority of the south also becomes suitable for economic wind energy generation. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_3848">But it is not only Germany: Google has calculated that less than 16% of all the onshore US sites are suitable for economic wind energy production with wind turbines. For wind drones this ﬁgure more than quadruples to 66% of the United States becoming viable

</Link>
areas of the world that do not have strong enough winds for conventional turbines will open up for wind energy production. </P>

<P>The fact that many new locations become economically viable energy producers by using wind drones has important economic implications for the total cost of the energy system, even for countries that do have good wind sites. Currently, for example Germany builds various high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power lines to transport wind energy from the north of the country, where the vast majority of wind energy is produced, to the south of the country, which has large demand for energy. The German government estimates that this and other grid enforcements to 
<Link>integrate wind energy will cost 21 Billion Euro for Germany alone [67]. In general, </Link>
the electric grid is a large cost factor in the total cost of electricity. Grid costs for private households were for example in Germany 6.76 Euro ct per kWh while the costs for power production was 
<Link>7.12 Euro ct per kWh [14].</Link>

<Link>8 </Link>
</P>

<P>Airborne wind energy would turn most regions into economically viable energy producers, which could make local or regional energy grids possible with less need to build large, strong and costly (supra)national grids. This would especially be a chance for developing countries in which the costly large grid systems do not yet exist. But building wind drones close to the demand centers—if the regulatory framework allows—will also lower the costs that developed countries have to invest to make their grid capable of dealing with a large percentage of renewable energy. </P>

<H4>1.9 The Reliable Renewable </H4>

<P>We have seen that wind drones should be able to produce cheaper energy and that they should be able to produce wind energy much more independently from the quality of the low-altitude wind resource. In the mid to long term a third characteristic of wind drones might turn out to be the economically most relevant: the high capacity factor does not only decrease the cost of energy, it also means that wind energy is available for the most time of the year and that wind energy is less ﬂuctuating. An energy source with higher quality: the reliable renewable. </P>

<P>Both, solar photovoltaics (solar PV) and conventional wind energy are highly intermittent. The average capacity factor in the USA is 37% for wind and only 20% for solar 
<Link>[69]. </Link>
This causes considerable concerns. Electricity grid operators face the challenge of matching the ﬂuctuating production of renewables with the demand.
<Link>9 </Link>
Current scenarios foresee the necessity to invest billions in stronger grids </P>

<P>8 On the basis of a consumption of 3500 kWh per year. The various surcharges for renewable </P>

<P>feed-in tariffs was another 6.62 Euro ct. 9 In 2015, in Germany alone more than 1 billion Euro of running costs had to be spent to maintain the integrity of the grid and to avoid blackouts due to power 
<Link>ﬂuctuations [49]. These costs already </Link>
today amount to enormous sums and they are expected to grow considerably if a higher fraction </P>

<P>and energy storage to enable a 100% renewable future. Therefore, while solar PV and conventional wind have at some places already reached so-called grid-parity, making them as cheap or cheaper than other sources of power, they can still not simply replace fossil fuel plants due to intermittency. If wind drones can produce with a capacity factor of about 70%, as envisaged by E.ON, or as high as 90% with optimized devices in optimal locations, they could largely replace coal, nuclear and gas power plants with a signiﬁcantly reduced necessity for investments in grid and storage. Grid and distribution costs already make up for the greater part of electricity bills. The high quality of wind drone power could become a decisive factor, even more important than its low cost which it can reach at the same time.
<Link>10 </Link>
</P>

<P>In a study of the French Utility EDF a European Grid is simulated in which 40% of the 
<Link>energy is contributed by ﬂuctuating wind and solar PV [15]. If </Link>
an additional 100 MW of conventional wind power are installed in such a scenario, only 20 MW of base load power stations, mostly fossil or nuclear, can be retired. If 100 MW of solar PV are installed, no base load power plants can be retired at all due to the even higher intermittency of solar power. With only little renewable penetration of the grid, as was the case at the beginning of large-scale solar and wind deployment in the 90s and the 2000s, every bit of renewable power was useful, since peak power plants had to work less often. Today, in Germany, there are certain days in which wind and solar produce more power than the country consumes. Wind power plants have to be shut down on more and more days because the power is not needed. Currently, the feed in tariffs in Germany and in many countries provide rules that pay the wind park owners for the virtual amount of power that they were not allowed to produce and to feed into the grid. This cannot and will not continue in the future, if such situations occur more often due to increased penetration of the grid by renewables. This means that, at a certain point, renewables will have to face market reality in which power prices are mostly dependent on the availability of other renewable power sources. If the sun is shining and the wind is blowing power prices fall, often close to zero. Sometimes even negative power prices are the result of such 
<Link>oversupply [37]. This </Link>
means that in the future, renewable power producers will only be able to sell their renewable power with proﬁt at those times at which other renewable energy sources cannot produce. </P>

<P>For airborne wind energy this means that it will be able to receive the best prices for its power not in the very windy time when also conventional wind turbines produce, but in those less windy times when they do not. To become a competitive </P>

<P>of power is produced with highly intermittent power sources or sources far away from power </P>

<P>consumption. 10 It should be noted that the capacity factor of every wind energy device, hence also for conventional wind, can of course be increased by design, simply by optimizing it for lower wind speeds. But optimizing for higher capacity factors than the 37% reached in the USA would make conventional wind more expensive. When optimizing for capacity factor, AWE has two advantages over wind turbines: ﬁrst, the possibility to reach higher altitudes with stronger and steadier winds allows to reduce intermittency and increase capacity factor without design changes, and second, the low material use of wind drones reduces the costs of designs with very large wings that are required to lower the rated wind speed and to further increase the capacity factor. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_3849">product wind drones will therefore have to be able to produce with a high capacity factor and low intermittency. </P>

<P>Furthermore, only in this case can they help to replace base load power plants on a large scale. Today, both politics and the energy industry have ﬁnally realized that in future power will have to be 100% renewable. But due to the low capacity factor and high intermittency of solar PV and conventional wind, the current realization is that ultra strong grids and vast amounts of storage capacity have to be built in addition to the renewables production capacity. However, a cheap and abundant storage technology does not exist yet. Storage technology is therefore often called the “holy grail” of the energy 
<Link>world [23, 29]. This perception may in part prove </Link>
being incorrect once AWE enters the market with its high capacity factor that comes close to that of today’s 
<Link>base load plants [69]. </Link>
</P>

<P>It is even possible to provide continuous electricity completely without storage, if various AWE parks that are connected by the grid are distributed over a larger area with different local winds. While no detailed studies on this presently exist for AWE, it is shown that even conventional wind can be distributed so that it covers 
<Link>local intermittency well [54]. Thus, given the much lower expected intermittency of </Link>
AWE, this should be even less of a problem for AWE. </P>

<P>The true economic advantage of the technology is therefore not limited to the lower price of energy compared to conventional wind. The savings in storage and grid capacity must be added to assess the full economic value of AWE to the world economy. A recent study assessed that an investment of over US$ 4.5 trillion was needed just for storage solutions for a 100% renewable energy system based on 
<Link>current solar PV, solar thermal and conventional wind technology [66]. A signiﬁcant </Link>
part of this investment could be saved with the help of AWE. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>1.10 Quantifying the Increase in Reliability: Measuring the Intermittency </H4>

<P>As discussed above, high-altitude winds not only have a higher average wind speed, but are also less intermittent and therefore a more reliable source of electricity. This 
<Link>is illustrated in Fig. 1.8 comparing statistical data at altitudes 145 and 265 m at Dres</Link>
den, Germany. In this context, less intermittent means that very low wind speeds occur less frequently. This can be 
<Link>seen in Fig. 1.8 (top). </Link>
</P>

<P>The example demonstrates that the much higher average wind power density at higher altitudes can be used to design a wind drone with a very reliable power output. The wind drone can be designed for a lower relative rated wind speed compared to the average wind speed that would be economically feasible for a wind turbine at lower altitudes. This trade-off, which is economically only available for very high average wind power densities, can be of paramount importance for an efﬁcient power grid operation and for the economic success of renewables. </P>

<P>But how much is the intermittency of the power output of a wind drone compared to a wind turbine at the same site? In this context, we can measure the intermittency </P>

of the time. This translates into a doubling of the capacity factor, from 16.5% for the wind turbine to 33.8% for the wind drone at this low wind location.

The data shows one signiﬁcant advantage of wind drones compared to wind turbines: the lower intermittency of wind drones leads to a higher quality of renewable energy and will be an important factor on the way to a 100% renewable future.

<Sect>
<H4>1.11 The Market for Airborne Wind Energy </H4>

<P>It has been shown that wind drones will be competitive with wind turbines and can be considered a superior energy source amongst renewables, providing reliability beneﬁts in addition to low price. The following is an attempt to assess the size of the market potential for this technology. </P>

<P>To begin with, the global wind turbine market is a large market. Its volume amounted to US$ 80 billion in 
<Link>2013 [35]. </Link>
Its growth rate averaged 25% per year over 
<Link>the last decade [43] and given </Link>
the political environment and the need to abandon fossil fuels, it is safe to assume that the market will continue to grow
<Link>14 </Link>
beyond the record year of 2015, when 63 GW of wind 
<Link>energy was installed [28, 55]. </Link>
</P>

<P>But wind energy is still only a small part of the total energy market and accounts for less than 1% of total global energy use.
<Link>15 </Link>
This will change. And it is mostly a question of competitiveness, more than of politics. Onshore wind turbines are on the brink of becoming competitive with coal and natural gas. This so called grid-parity has been reached in some regions. It means that wind energy is already the cheapest source of electricity even without subsidies. Wind drones have the potential to produce at one quarter of the costs, can provide steadier production, and have the </P>

<P>11 It should be noted, that the wind drone was not optimized for a deployment at relatively low wind speeds, and that the available wind data did not allow for a dynamic optimization of the ﬂight altitude of the wind drone. Also, no wind data was available for the maximum ﬂight altitude of the wind drone of up to 450 m. Thus, it can be expected that the real increase in reliability of the power output of AWE can be even higher. </P>

<P>12 This increase by a factor of two corresponds to the ratio of the integrals of the two curves in </P>

<P>
<Link>Fig. 1.9. </Link>
13 Optimizing the intermittency might involve ﬂying at altitudes higher than the design value at times of low wind. This might not be their most efﬁcient mode of operation, but if there is only wind at several hundred meters altitude, wind drones can use these high-altitude winds to produce at least some energy. This is in stark contrast to wind turbines, which cannot adjust their height to where the wind happens to be. Technological challenges like less efﬁcient angles of attack and increased tether drag will be hurdles on the way to these altitudes, but nevertheless it remains a possibility and ideas for future improvements are 
<Link>numerous, for example using dancing kites [76]. </Link>
</P>

<P>14 
<Link>See the accelerated market forecast in [42]. </Link>
15 
<Link>0.3% in 2011: wind 434 TWh, total energy demand: 13,070 Mtoe (= 152,000 TWh) [43] </Link>
</P>

<P>ability to be deployed almost anywhere. This means that wind drones do not only compete with wind turbines in their niche, but have a realistic chance of becoming the cheapest source of electricity: cheaper than coal, gas, nuclear and hydro power. </P>

<P>And since electric cars are on the rise, the electricity produced by wind drones will be able to compete with oil as a transportation fuel. Electriﬁcation of transport will end a monopoly for oil that has allowed oil to be one of the most costly sources of energy for a long time. In the fully electriﬁed economy of the future all sources of energy can 
<Link>compete with each other [13]. And oil will have </Link>
a hard time competing with wind drones, even at the current low oil prices. Taking into account the inefﬁciencies of the combustion engine, oil at US$ 60 per barrel is still a more expensive source of power for a car than the electricity produced by today’s wind turbines.
<Link>16 </Link>
Based on the analysis above, oil would have to sell at a quarter of that price, below US$ 15 per barrel to compete with wind drone energy on a pure cost of fuel basis. </P>

<P>So how large is the market potential for wind drones? This is hard to say exactly, 
<Link>but looking at Table 1.1, which lists the companies with the largest </Link>
revenue worldwide, we can get a rough idea of the full market potential for AWE. In the next two decades, the market for fossil fuels has to be taken over by renewables in order to keep our planet from overheating. Since the UN Climate Change Conference 2015 in Paris it is the declared will of all governments in the world to make this hap
<Link>pen [74]. If the current policies regarding CO</Link>
2 emissions are continued, by 2034 the burning of fossil fuels would have to be stopped completely to comply with the 2◦C </P>

<H4>1.12 Future Goals for Airborne Wind Energy </H4>

<P>We have seen how the laws of mechanics in combination with sensors, chips and smart algorithms can replace the tons of steel and concrete that wind turbines are made of. This can make power produced by the ﬁrst generation of wind drones cheaper than electricity from fossil fuels. Their ability to harvest stronger winds at higher altitudes gives wind drones the potential to provide power where it is needed irrespective of the existing wind resource. Cost-effective electricity made by wind drones could even provide the basis for the clean synthetic fuels of the future. And this fuel could be available at less than today’s oil price—even taking the historically low prices of at the beginning of the year 2016 into account. </P>

<P>Once AWE matures, a lack of wind will no longer be a problem. We have seen how the wind resource dramatically improves by increasing the altitude to 250 m or even 500 m. But this is only the ﬁrst hop of the very ﬁrst generation of wind drones into the air. Once these altitudes are mastered, it will be tempting to gradually go higher, for example towards 1,000 to 2,000 meters.
<Link>17 </Link>
The wind speed proﬁle 
<Link>above the center of London, illustrated in Fig. 1.5, shows </Link>
how much is to be gained by increasing the altitude even further, at least at certain locations. At 1,500 m the average wind speed above London is 20 m/s, corresponding to almost storm-like conditions, which is deﬁned as a wind above 20.8 m/s. This more or less continuous storm leads to a four-fold increase of available wind power compared to the situation at 500 m and to a twenty-fold increase compared to 120 m, the altitude of today’s wind turbines, that is 4143 vs. 924 vs. 210 W/m2. </P>

<P>The ultimate dream of airborne wind energy would be reaching the jet stream at an altitude of about 10 km. Before this is possible, many technical and legal problems will have to be solved, however. And it might turn out in the end that it is not the most economical solution. But given the strong development the ﬁeld has taken in the last 10 years, it is reasonable to expect that it will be earnestly attempted. The wind resources at this altitude are simply too enticing. A map of the winds at the al
<Link>titude of present wind turbines and at jet stream altitudes is shown in Fig. 1.10. The </Link>
median energy density over New York at this height is more than 10 kW/m2 
<Link>[6], of </Link>
which about 5 kW/m2 can theoretically be harvested.
<Link>18 </Link>
The total average continuous energy consumption per person in the US amounts to 10.5 kW. This includes all electricity use, heating, car and aviation fuels, and even industrial energy consump
<Link>tion [75]. This </Link>
means that harvesting wind in an area of 2 m2 per person, the size of an open front door, could on average provide all our energy. If ten wind turbines </P>

<P>17 To produce wind energy at these altitudes economically, technical solutions for lowering the </P>

<P>tether drag have to be implemented, for 
<Link>example by using the dancing kite concept [76]. </Link>
18 The theoretical maximum is the Betz limit 16/27 or 59%. Modern wind turbines are very close to this with efﬁciencies of about 50%, including losses in generators, drivetrains etc. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_3852">Of course it might seem unrealistic to reach these altitudes with the present day technology, with tethers, their weight and aerodynamics being the major hindrances. However, when Miles Loyd invented crosswind airborne wind energy in the second half of the 1970s, it seemed inconceivable to use AWE at all. Now, 40 years later, it is a reality, and thus those who made AWE a reality should not stop dreaming big. </P>

<H4>1.13 Conclusion </H4>

<P>The past decades have seen a revolution of digital technology, in the processing power of computers, in terms of robustness, and in the accompanying improvements of mostly digital sensors such as accelerometers and GPS. This revolution has brought us into the age of drones. Drones will have a very wide array of applications, and maybe the most important one will be in airborne wind energy, the “wind drone”. </P>

<P>Wind drones can harvest stronger and steadier winds at higher and at varying altitudes. Wind drones require only a fraction of the material investment of wind turbines, since they replace the mechanical sturdiness of the wind turbine by a fragile ﬂight, reliably controlled by clever autonomous control algorithms. Since they implement only the aerodynamically most efﬁcient part of the wind turbine, the tip of the rotor blade, leaving out all the inefﬁcient rest, they can ﬂy higher in more reliable winds and cover larger areas. This leads to a higher capacity factor with lower intermittency and, very roughly estimated, a quarter of the cost of energy. Wind drones have the unique potential to represent the most reliable abundant renewable energy, thus potentially saving billions of dollars otherwise required for making the power grids more robust against variations in power production and consumption in space and time. Given the enormous technical and ﬁnancial challenges the grid operators are facing even now, it is possible that the indirect cost savings of wind drones compared to conventional wind might be even bigger than the direct cost advantage. </P>

<P>The economic future of wind drones looks bright and the development of the ﬁrst commercial prototypes is in full swing. At the same time, new concepts are being explored by a growing number of researchers and start-ups. </P>

<P>Burning fossil fuels started the industrial revolution. It enabled the advances of mankind in the last 200 years and the strong exponential growth the world economy experienced ever since. Without fossil fuels, feeding 7 billion people on this planet would be impossible. But fossil fuels also destroy and pollute nature, poison our cities and homes and cause an ever more dangerous climate change. These so called external effects lead not only to human suffering but also to large costs that are not paid for by those responsible for the pollution, but by the global community. Nonetheless, these costs have to be paid and cause slower growth and development. </P>

<P>Solving huge environmental and economic problems with existing technologies would require unimaginable resources, which is why Bill Gates and others have called for an energy miracle. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_3853">Wind drones could be such a miracle. They can tap the richest and most concentrated source of renewable energy that is otherwise literally out of reach for humanity: high-altitude winds. And wind drones are digital products that can be scaled up and brought to utility scale very fast. We believe that wind drones are the digital products that will revolutionize the energy market, the largest market in the world. The digital revolution quickly disrupts the new market it enters, leaving old technology no chance to compete. Wind drones can become for oil majors what Amazon.com was for bookstores. </P>

<P>When mankind started to burn fossil fuels it made a huge leap forward. The day it stops to burn fossil fuels, it will make another big step towards a better world. Wind drones might bring this day much closer than most of us believe today. </P>
